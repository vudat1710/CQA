i am currently working here in dubai and i got an offer from qatar company.. they offered 8000QAR +camp accommodation +meal and transportation is provided by the company... will this be enough to accept the offer? how good is the transportation there in qatar?	depends on where the accommodation is.. how many people will live with you; what kind of food. Why dont u ask your company to provide you transportation and ask for 4k more as accommodation and food allowance. Most importantly; 8k isnt a great salary but it all again depends on your job profile and work experience.	1
i am currently working here in dubai and i got an offer from qatar company.. they offered 8000QAR +camp accommodation +meal and transportation is provided by the company... will this be enough to accept the offer? how good is the transportation there in qatar?	If the company is from Oil and Gas Industry or working for that Industry; then their accommodation and transport will be better. If it is normal construction company; they dont have good facilities. As far as your question of salary is concerned; you dont need to ask; as Dubai is not so different from Qatar and the currency is also the same.	1

The camp at NDIA is not too bad. Cabins are only a few years old and there are plenty facilities. Transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minutes driving max. Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal! If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here.	1

Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal! If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here.	1

What can I possibly say about the Fetish Barbie scheduled to spank uh; hit store shelves this autumn? Only that its about time. And I have to have one. Theres a whole cadre of people who have never liked the anatomically impossible dolls squeaky-clean image; some of us even suspected there was a kinky woman inside.

Discussing with my company regarding annual increment of allowance. Is there any official statistics about increment of prices in Qatar? Something official statistics agency; Central Bank of Qatar or similar?	there has been much press lately about the drop in prices; food; and especially housing prices have been decreasing. So if you bring up a need for an increase in your allowances and salary right now; you probably won't get very far; maybe even have allowances decreased! There is something called the Qatar Statistics Authority at http://www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm May be helpful; but not sure. The English spelling in their reports is atrocious; they even spell literacy wrong! Makes me wonder about errors in their methodologies and data collection if they can't get even that right.	1
Discussing with my company regarding annual increment of allowance. Is there any official statistics about increment of prices in Qatar? Something official statistics agency; Central Bank of Qatar or similar?	well; discussion has to be based in something with an official "smell".

Lets talk next year :) War looking for peace; is like fornication looking for virginity.	1

Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	If you have time and you're a patient person; please go for HSBC. It takes in average 30 minutes to reach someone when you call the customer service! And if you call after 5 PM; after waiting 30 minutes they will ask you to call the day after. Another one from HSBC; if you travel abroad; they may eventually block your credit card (for security reason) and will inform you only when you are back in Qatar. I was left in Thailand without being able to use my credit card and didnt had a single $ to buy food! Thanks to HSBC. I moved to Commercial Bank (CBQ) and I'm very happy :-)	1

I have been looking for months for a judo club. There's a federation here but when i contacted them they couldnt really tell me where i could find a club for my son. It seems that judo is taught here in schools but only for qataris! There must be a club somewhere in Doha that accepts non qataris. Does anyone know of a judo club; my son is 5 years old. thanks	There are few martial arts centres here in Doha. There is one behind Ramada Hotel and at the back of Mega mart; there is also one opposite the Jarrir book shop	1

There is no private JUDO clubs except the federations without proper motivations for their players. The closes thing that I saw is the one near to Frinje Naseer area. It is Jujitsu Club. As you know Jujitsu is the first cousin of JUDO. I think I will enroll there; cause I am become rusty as days passby. They are open in the evening.	1

The Dojo is under umbrella of the KARATE ACADEMY in Al Sadd Area near to Jarir Book Store and Doha Clinic Hospital. The Timing of the practice is SUN-TUES-THURS at 18:30-19:45 under Coach Saeed who is a former Qatar Olympic player for 12yrs. If you are interested you can contact these nos: 4421142 or 5220806.

Does anyone know of a judo club; my son is 5 years old. thanks	Dottymum; Sorry for the late reply. I teach judo at a school; and no; your child is too small for my club because five years old is the bare minimum to start judo; otherwise; the judo club becomes a day care. I would start with the Qatari Judo Federation. They seem to be pretty good with the kids. I haven't worked out with the adult players; because they are always training elsewhere. But the few times I've gone to visit them; there were kids working out. Tunisians are the instructors; and if your game to learn (or already know) French; I would enroll them in their program. They seem very qualified. It's an Arabic/French class at one of the local sports clubs around the Dafna area. Let me know; and I can try to get you contacted with the right people.	1

Hi all; I am seriously considering moving to Qatar. I've just finished my PhD in civil engineering (Geotechnics); I have only 1 year experience. I am German. How much should I expect in Qatar now?

I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver; have heard some agencies here in DOha do it...any tips?? Many thanks	My experience with Eurodollar: I asked them about what happens if there is a minor scratch. They say that there are sometimes charges of 20/30 QR. A few weeks later; the car needed to come into service. The car had small scratch on front bumper. They make a big deal of it even though I am pretty sure it was there before I hired it. After service; they did not mention it and I took it out for another month. Next day they phoned me saying it would need to be charged at 450 QR! I tell them that they are taking the piss and ask to speak to the manager. A man phones later and insists I pay it claiming I need things like police reports etc - when I refuse he tells me to return the car. I say no problem if you give me back my money for the month I have hired the car. I suggest he comes into work and picks up the car. He does not come in and does not phone again. Next day; car has a problem and won't start (it has lots of little problems due to poor servicing). They come out with new key but take much longer than they said they would. The same guy finally turns up with another who looks threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch. I tell them my feelings that it is minor but he makes a big deal about needing to get the whole bumper re-sprayed and that anybody doing the job for 100 QR (as I thought reasonable) would not do a good job. He says that as I am such a pal he will reduce it to 350 QR and that he will pay the remaining 100 QR. Basically; I have to agree to pay or there will be no new key. I take the car to the main dealers and they quote 100 QR!!!! I believe that it is not likely that the main dealers for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it comes to spraying. I suggest you avoid Eurodollar as they are trying to squeeze money out of any opportunity... Even worse than the other car hire places I have tried.	1

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha	No but there are Americans that could possibly be baptists.......that go to church.....but probably not to a baptist church in Doha.......	1
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha	The Anglican church of Doha is where most "english'speaking people go to in doha. Their church building is still under construction in the Abu Hamour church complex.But their services take place in Doha English speaking school(DESK)near Markhiya round about. Entry to the place is restricted and Qatar police will be gaurding the gate always. so if you want to go you have to call the pastor and inform him so they will add your name to the list with the police. If you need the phone number just write back.	1
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha	There are no Baptist churches as such in Doha. Only a handful of Christian communities are allowed to have recognized; sponsored; full-time clergy; and the Baptists are not one of them. The Emir graciously granted land to the Anglican church to lead the various independent Protestant Christian communities in Doha to contract a Protestant center. Most Baptists and evangelical Christians I know tend to go to the non-denominational Christian communities such as Doha Fellowship and Grace Fellowship. Both have webpages. Like the Anglican church (and much of Qatar for the that matter) services are conducted in English; but a fair number of participants do not speak English as their first language. Hope you find what you are looking for.	1

However; you need to book in December to get a place. Doha Vets have just opened a new facility; call them on 4367187; they may be able to help you; the price will be less if you can find someone who is prepared to share the cage with their cat (if and only if they get along well). Also check with QAWS; they may have space but you really will be very lucky to pay less than the going rate; competition for cages is strong at this time of year. There is a lady who will visit your house daily; change the litter and feed but it is very sad to leave a lone cat for a month; if you consider doing this why not offer a home to one of QAWS many cats looking for a home? Then; you can leave the cat knowing he will be happy and also giving a home to a cat who really needs it. jj	1

We're a rescue shelter only. If you're looking for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you are away you will need to spend more then that. 2 months boarding in any of the catteries here in Qatar would be a minimum of QR2;400. And it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him.	1

Hi; I am currently looking for a security based job in Qatar. As an ex British soldier; I can adapt and learn very easily and with my past experience I will be looking for a reasonable salary. Can anyone recommend any companies that I can apply to please? Any help would be really appreciated.	Thank you for your response. I very much appreciate it. I know what a reasonable salary in the UK/Europe would be but unsure about here in Qatar. What do you think a reasonable salary would be and package? I look forward to hearing from you. regards	0

It is my impression that any security job in Qatar will be extremely low-paying when compared to a UK salary. Mandi	0
