Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	Hi Aunt Polly, here are the details: 1. Complete your documents, check the website    http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/asia/vkwt/ref_visinf/viskwt.html 2. You will have to send your original passports thru DHL or Fedex (they know what to do) at: Embassy of Switzerland in Kuwait (also accredited in Qatar and Bahrain) Qortuba, Block 2, Street 1, House No 122 P.O. Box 23954 Safat 13100 Kuwait Tel. +965 534 01 72/73/74/75 Fax  +965 534 01 76 Public opening hours Sunday-Thursday 9:00-11:00 Visa section: Sunday-Thursday 9:00-11:00 (Kuwait have the same time as we have here in Qatar, so you can call and ask them for more of your questions ONLY on the times stated) 3. You pay a courier charge to Kuwait. Wait in 3-5 working days, it will arrive to you (either approved or denied) and you will again be charged depending if you are approved or not. 4. Enjoy the holidays in Switzerland. Its best to go there during the winters to see the snow-capped mountains and stuff. But summer is ok too.	1
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	If you are just interested to visit Switzerland, you might attempt to get a schengen visa from any european embassy in Qatar, say the Italian Embassy. If you get it, you can travel all over Europe including Switzerland.   Qatar's Online Store Shop online, same-day delivery to your door in Qatar! www.simpatico.com.qa	1
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	No offense Simpatico, but you are wrong. Switzerland is not part of the the Schengen Visa circle. Swiss has been a long time-neutral country, and they even use their own money, Francs and not Euro. Been there. That's what it is.	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	Thank you kikomodos and  Eco savvy- thanks for taking the time to reply to this post Thanks very much Simpatico , you have been extremely helpful . Aunt Polly	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	You are right the Shengen visa used to include 7 countries now more  as far as I understand as I used to get this for my ex-husband to trave around Europe. The Shengen visa does also not iclude UK.	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	so really what i have to do is to send my documents to Kuwait , right ? I am also planning to visit Italy , France and Holland alongwith - so will a common Schengen visa do for all these countries ? Aunt Polly	0

Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	The Shengen Visa allows you to visit these countries. Germany Belgium Denmark Finland France Greece Iceland Italy Luxemburg Norway Portugal Spain Sweden The Netherlands Austria	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	Aunt Polly, my family and I did it. Yes, even if you check with DHL or Fedex, they know it, and they know what to do. But you'll have to complete your papers adn plan your trip well, as the processing takes (max) of 5 working days in all. Yes, you'll need a separate Schengen Visa for those countries you mentioned (except Holland). The 15 Schengen countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. All these countries except Norway and Iceland are European Union members. When you know your 1st Schengen-visa valid country, that will be your visa application. Say, your 1st destination before or after Swiss is Italy, then you have to get your Schengen Visa from the Italian Embassy here. Once you have the visa, you can roam around 15 countries! Cheers.	1
Hi there, I am coming to doha on Thursday and I know I will need a tourist visa. Someone mentioned that I get it at the airport for 55riyals, is this correct? I saw on the Qatar Government website that you needed evidence of which hotel you would be staying in? But I am staying with friends during my stay? Any advice would be good as I am quite nervous about flying alone and dont want any problems when I arrive! Thanks, Beth :-)	You do not mention what passport you hold. Either way your travel agent should have arranged everything for you. I would be VERY hesitant to travel anywhere in teh world if I did not know what the visa requirements were for a particular country. On the other hand the airline carrying you to Qatar would ultimately be responsible for you and will not allow you to board if your paperwork is not in order. Check out the Qatar Government websites if you have the opportunity. Good Luck.	1

I have not booked through a travel agency, which is why I am now looking at visas. I know I need a tourist visa, I just want to know how to get one. Every time I ring the embassy in London, there is no one in the visas department. I was told my someone in my Fiance's company that you pay 55riyals on arrival at Doha airport, but obviously I need to check this is correct. I am flying with Emirates. Thanks!	0

All need to show they have US$.1370.00 in cash or equivalent in foreign currency (or a credit card) to be eligible to enter Qatar. You might need to show a confirmed hotel booking. Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vatican.	1

Thanks, Beth :-)	I too was worried about the new visa regulations about having 5000 riyals or valid international credit card and hotel voucher upon arrival, as I have relatives coming out here in 2 weeks time. (Family and they are regular visitors). I have been told by other people who have had visitors arrive that it's no problem .. still the same as before 55 riyals for 3 week visa on arrival (with option of renewing for the extra week at 50QR). Fingers crossed.	0

I have a british credit card, like Natwest and Alliance and Leicester, I dont know if that counts as international though. I'm worried that they will ask for hotel reservation details and then there will be a problem when they realise I intend to stay with male friends....:S I will ring the embassy on Monday to confirm. It says on world travel guide you have to fly in on Qatar Airlines to geta tourist visa, surely that is wrong! Im flying Emirates... Beth	1

I saw on the Qatar Government website that you needed evidence of which hotel you would be staying in? But I am staying with friends during my stay? Any advice would be good as I am quite nervous about flying alone and dont want any problems when I arrive! Thanks, Beth :-)	My parents have only ever visited here with Emirates Airlines. They have been 3 times now and have had no problems whatsoever. However, these new regulations have come in to effect ... but as mentioned, speaking to people who had just had visitors they have had no problems and wasn't asked to provide anything. If you are a bit nervous ... you can get your friends to organise a meet and greet service for you. You can book them at any Qatar Airways office ... doesn't matter what airline you are arriving in. Costs around 70 riyals (can't remember exactly) and they will meet you when you get off the plane, seat you in a room with refreshments then organise your visa .. you can pay a bit extra (10 riyals) and they will even pick up your luggage for you and escort you thru customs It's a great service, especially if you are unsure or nervous. Good luck.	1

They're required by law to make sure they're not carrying undesirable aliens, so it's in their interest to make sure everything's in order. I'm pretty sure you'll be OK so long as you can persuade immigration that you're a bona-fide short term tourist, which is why a hotel booking is recommended. It might help to have ask your friends for their job details, address & RP number. (They'll know what that is.) If you're at all young or attractive, they'll be suspicious that you might be a prostitute. Note that in all these respects, it's exactly the same for non-EC tourists entering the UK or Brits entering the USA.	1

This is the first time for me planning to visit some country in the region of the Middle East and I thought it would be better if I get all the needed info in advance. The problem is that I am not sure what kind of visa should I be obtained, as a southeastern European citizen (but still not in the EU), during the visit that I have planned for upcoming December. My girlfriend is employed by a certain company in Doha for past two months and Iâ€™d be staying at her flat for about 3 weeks. I've heard it is almost illegal being at apartment of a woman with a â€˜singleâ€™ marital status! Is this possible?? Iâ€™d be very grateful if someone could provide me some info about the local regulations or any suggestion considering my case. Thank You in advance for any help provided!	0

Im going to ring embassy on Monday and find out once and for all. Can I book that service while in the UK or does someone else need to do it for me and if so can they arrange it when they come to get me from the airport in Doha or does it need to be in advance?

Foreigners can own freehold and some property leasehold for 99 years. Residency permits are distributed to the buyer along with up to 5 direct family members.

I was told that the Pearl project is being offered by many companies and at a variety of terms. Also, I was wondering if the Pearl is the only place at this time. I checked Damac for Lusiel but I was not convinced for some reason. Anyone looked at the development project in Al-Khor?	amnesia, prove to me that I can stay for the rest of my life and after me my children if I buy property in Qatar, and I will do it!	0

Usually online applications like that one you have got is a fraud, so better check their website and see if there really are job vacancies for that particular position. Do not give any of your personal details, like you bank account, SSS or anything. They even will try to call you on your mobile just to prove their "authenticity" but do not be trapped with it. I receive same almost regularly on my email. But just ignore them.	1

One quick question, why did they send you an online interview form? Did you contact them or did they pick your name and email out of a hat. I would NEVER pay a company to hire you, regardless of what the money is going to. If they can't pay it themself, you don't want to work for them.	0

Hi Everyone I will be arriving in Doha in the next couple of weeks and will need to rent a car soon after I arrive. I was wondering if anyone knew how easy/difficult it is to do this and what would be the costs? Also names and contacts of rental companies. I will be bringing with me a UK driving Licence and an international driving licence. I will be needing a five door hatchback model, nothing too large or fancy and will be needing to rent for 3 or 4 months. Any advice would be appreciated.

Speedway Rent a car 444-2299 Ask for Michael You can rent a car with your International Driving License. Legally you can drive with this license for 6 months after your first date of arrival in Doha. But each rental car company has different policy. Some rental car company allow you to rent their car with Internatioal Driving License for 2 months, some for a few weeks. So, you must shop around for more detail. Since, you are from the UK I would recommend you to wait for your company to issue you a letter to obtain a local Qatari Driving License. This letter will be in Arabic and you can obtain a new license on exchange basis. They will just look at your local UK license, give you eyes exam then you are done. Just pay the money and you will get the new Qatari license right away. With Qatari License you can rent a car from anywhere with less restrictions. Qatari Driving License Documents Needed 1.Arabic Letter from your company 2.Passport copy with RP copy 3.Color photo (No white background) If you war glasses or contact lense, you must wear glass while taking picture. 4.Applicaiton Fee payby credit card or ATM card (No cash accepted) 5.Enjoy your new License Goodluck in Doha!	1

I would strongly recommend getting rent a car at airport. After 2 years here, I would consider that the best move I have made sence being here. Had your same creditials, got a car for a month, in the meanwhile looked for a car to buy. You definitely need a car in this city. I don't care if you pay a cab and you follow it to your place to stay. I beg you to rent a car at the airport.

hi all i arrive here with the sponsor of my husband with visit visa.i get entry visa for 2months.and stay of 1 month. i can extend stay till 6 months. i am hunting for a job here in qatar. the companyn that i am applying for a job said to apply for those in family visa. so what's the difference between my visa and family visa? of is it the same? pls answer me bk ASAP. thanks...	hi there! just some clarifications...i know those who are in family visit visa have the privilege for a 1 month stay and can get it extended for 5 months. Im quite confused with the 2 months entry and 1 month stay...? extension maybe?..that might be a business visa i guess. Husband sponsored visa is entirely different because your validity of stay in qatar depends totally on your husband visa status...? Maybe what the company meant was they accept applicants or workers only for those with husband visa sponsorship...Anyway look for company which can provide a working visa, if you do have more time. Good luck and God bless on your job hunt!	1

Families of sponsored residents may enter Qatar on a short-term Family Visit Visa. The visa is valid for one month. However, relatives who wish to stay beyond one month may undergo a physical examination within the first 72 hours of arrival to apply for an extension. The visa can be extended to cover a maximum of six months only (five extendable months for immediate family members and two months for second-degree relatives).	1

Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship.

Your Salary Certificate and Your Contract should match. So if your visa is an Engineer so thats means that the profession written on your contract is an Engineer, you have to approach to your HR or Admin or whoever prepares your Salary Certificate to match what is written on your Contract profession	1

Make sure Engineer is also also the designation written in your contract documents. Then try top submit it again, and go to the immigration office at earliest possible time.	1

Hello all. I am currently interviewing for a nanny. We found someone who we would like to employ, BUT she said that her current employer will only give her a NOC (no objection certificate) if she or I pay them 6000 Riyals??? She has worked for them for 4 years. Can I still employ her without the NOC?. I don't think its fair that they are asking for 6000 QAR......Any help/advise will be greatly appreciated. Thanks	I just spoke to a man who works as a PRO in immigration. He told me that it will cost me about 10 000 QAR for me to be the new sponsor. That amount will also include the 6000 QAR that I have to pay her current Sponsor.	1

I release my maids at no cost! especially those who are troublesome! Worse comes to worst you will pay for that amount and the maid is a troublesome! so how can you get your expenses back? If they are good worker the employer will keep them and will not try to make money in order to release them! they only demand because they think they have waste a lot of money employing her!	1

If she does not get her NOC then will she have to leave the country?? Is there any way in which I can avoid paying the 6000 QAR? Thanks	0

Thanks	Exactly! they should not charge you any penny as she already worked with them for 4 years! If they send her home, you cannot hire her directly without an NOC she has to wait for another 3 years before she can enter Qatar again. In that sense, there's no way you can avoid paying the QR6,000. If you are going to hire from the agencies you will find out eventually that, you will spend more or less the same amount! If your instinct say she's worth it, then go for it! but if you find it too expensive, as I said there are lots of them looking for job who are already there, it will suit you according to your budget! ;)	1

We are thinking of hiring a maid without using an agency. We know of someone we can bring from Ethiopia. What are the steps we need to do to bring her? Can we do this without the help of an agency? Thanks!!	I think you have to apply for a visa for this maid.	1
We are thinking of hiring a maid without using an agency. We know of someone we can bring from Ethiopia. What are the steps we need to do to bring her? Can we do this without the help of an agency? Thanks!!	As far as i know, You need to get a NOC letter from your employer, which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary, and the nationality of the maid you want to get. Take this to the labour department on C-ring road (i guess), there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC. Will take atleast a week for the approval to come. Once you get the approval, give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids, and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa, flights, etc.	1

I am just thinking from layman point (not expert); I am sure husband and wife can be under different sponsorships (saw it earlier) so if marriage certificate is there, then there should not be issue from legal point of view. Family status by company just means that they will add benefit in the compensation and nothing else (means you need to buy medical for the new born). Best of luck.	1

With your sponser (wife) permission you can admit your wife in to Hamad Hospital, once baby deliverd you can go and register your baby on your Embossey and get pasport. After that you do the madical examination and let your baby with your wife for ever.	1

Is this possible.??	1.Go to the NATIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY and fill application.When they issue cash receipt they will advise you to go to CID office at Industrial Area. 2.You should take a Guarantor passport and take him also to CID office in industrial area. 3.CID will issue a birth certificate and this will help you to take a temporarory PP to your baby. 4.Take this temporory PP to immigration and fill application for new Baby. Remember (A) Baby + mother should go (B) Wear good attire (C)Go to abu hamour immigration early morning.(Officials are gentle) 5.Get the RP for the baby 6.After taking RP go to the CID office to take the PP of your friend. 7.CID chek the legality here.As per Qatar labour law any housemaid can't have baby.So most probably they might not give the PP 8.No problem 9.GO to the NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS in midmac.Tell your story right from the begining. 10.They will issue a letter to Labour department to bring your wife sponsorship under you. 11.Do not waste single minute. 12.Any problem u send me email to gunawathie@yahoo.com, I can help within my limit. 13.Your baby is given by ALLAH only.He is the creator.So pray him and take the VISA.

Is this possible.??	yes you can have children legally here as long as you and your wife are legally married and have a marriage certificate. Because when your wife go to hospital for check up and when she will deliver the baby in the hospital, the hospital will ask you to submit the marriage certificate. when you will register to have a Birth Certificate at the Supreme Council for Health they will again ask for the marriage certificate and when you will apply for your baby visa, they will not require for a NOC, just the baby passport, you and your wife passport and RP ID.	1

Does anyone knows if an husband, which is under his wife sponsorship, could work without changing the sponsorship? And if so, what are the options? If anyone could guide us or provide paid services, please let me know. Thanks.	Not certain if there is much of a difference, but there are 10s of thousands of women here under their spouse's sponsorship who work with no problems. In fact, they get jobs faster than anyone requiring a new work visa, and usually a higher salary for providing their own...	1

Her employer has made her sign a contract stating that if I get work them her sponsorship must change to mind - BUT that is their particular rules ( they are a big Q-company) and not everyone is the same. Immigration only need to see a NOC from your wife if you are to work	1

Hi There, Could anyone please advise me how I could change the sponsorship of my maid? She is currently under my fathers sponsorship but since he is leaving the country my husband wants to employ her. Is this possible and how does he go about this? Any help will be appreciated.	You still need to get a release letter from your father and then go to Immigration Department and apply for a visa for her! Judge not! that you be not judged!	1

Check the Diff and will like u to go check the immigration booth first. Applying for visa is something else changing sponsor ship is something else she is asking for transferring of her RP NOT VISA.

Hi There, Could anyone please advise me how I could change the sponsorship of my maid? She is currently under my fathers sponsorship but since he is leaving the country my husband wants to employ her. Is this possible and how does he go about this? Any help will be appreciated.	1. Your husband has to check if he can acquire a visa for a maid under his name. 2. He has to apply for that visa. 3. The maid has to be different from your nationality.(that's I am not sure if still the current law) 4. Once your husband has been approved for his application to sponsor a maid, he then can get the visa transfer form. 5. He has to ask your father to sign it and your maid to sign it. 6. Your father has to make a release letter for your maid 7. You can submit those papers to the Immigration. I hope the above could help you, I am no immigration expert here, I just read those previou thread and gather the above informations from it. I am not sure also, how long it will take (the processing) Goodluck! Cheers!

The economic slowdown has now hit the Middle East. Dubai's largest construction company Damac is laying off over 2000 200 workers . Projects launch dates are being pit back. Asset rich multi-millionaires here have no cash and properties sales are now just not happening. I'm personally feeling the affects here in Dubai. How is the Qatar economy performing and has anyone there starting feeling the pinch yet? Your views would be appreciated. :)	As we get paid in GBP it means everything here has jumped in price by 25%. That sucks.	1

The economic slowdown has now hit the Middle East. Dubai's largest construction company Damac is laying off over 2000 200 workers . Projects launch dates are being pit back. Asset rich multi-millionaires here have no cash and properties sales are now just not happening. I'm personally feeling the affects here in Dubai. How is the Qatar economy performing and has anyone there starting feeling the pinch yet? Your views would be appreciated. :)	Isn't damac the company building expensive houses over here?

I'm far from being a financial expert but even I can spot the signs. But I'm still more annoyed at the weak pound and consequential 25% increase in my living expenses!	0

Government spending has been cut by 10% and companies with projects being funded by the government have been told to cut their spending by 10% i.e. Qatar foundation, QP etc So it has had a marginal effect, but it is more a case of pre-empting something rather than Qatar reacting to the current affairs. The average person probably won't notice it though, unless you are one of the unfortunate ones being paid in USD or GBP ____________________________	1

The Emirates quote is from Doha, via Dubai. price includes return flight from Doha. So Qatar Airways wants $1300 Canadian for a 6 1/2 hr direct flight. Calgary Canada to Thailand, which has 2 connections and is a 24 hour flight is only $1600. $300 more. I don't get how Qatar Airways can justify $1300 Canadian for a 6 1/2 hr flight???

It provides more routes and flies direct to their destinations. Therefore it can charge more. If you don't mind stop-overs choose the other carriers on the basiss of cost. I like Expedia for comparing prices. Mandi	1
I live in Turkey and I applied to Qatar Airlines for cabin crew position last month. I received an e-mail today; they want me pre-employment medical examinations. I have never been in Qatar before and although I'm a Muslim, I'm afraid of the strict rules there. Should I leave everything behind me and take the job? Is anybody here who works as cabin crew?	Well, Qatar itself does not have Strict Rules, Why not do a Search on QL, regrading this matter, there have been threads previously Regarding Cabin Crew working for QA.	1

Qatar has strict islamic rules, compared to say UAE. But nothing over the top like Saudi. My friend works for QA. She has a 3:30 am curfew (which is fine 'cause all hotel clubs and late night places close by 3 am give or take). Also, you can't have a guest in your accomodation past 10pm. If your walking around on the street / outside malls, be prepared to receive all kinds of unwated attention from guys in white land cruisers. But shouldn't be a problem as cabin crew are trained on how to handle unwanted attention, lol.	1

The employers of QA talked about the dressing rules in Qatar, for example the length of our skirts or shorts. Or the Ramadan rules... It's forbidden to eat and drink outside during the fast time.

Flying Ace, employees of QA does their job and gets paid for it...if work not done they should nt be in QA.. also there are people in each n every company who leaves the company even after they got promoted as per their wish without serving notice period just becz they are getting better offer in other company. so if u r working upto the standard then no company will ask you to leave.	1

It should be " He lost a lot of weight" because the ist sentence reads like " He is lost a lot of weight" The apostrophe symbolizes the missing letter "I" ..	1

Woman:  Yes, he is rather slender these days, isn't he?	Those used to speaking slang might nor notice the gramatical error, but it's there (as everyone already ponted out).     "He's" implying "he has" is only used in slang and is technically gramatically incorrect because "he's" is supposed to be a replacement for "he is". Aslo, the term thin vs the term slender is not really a gramatical infrigement (although I do agree with you that it may have been more appropriate under the current circumstances). Stay safe. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore, is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?	1

Woman:  Yes, he is rather slender these days, isn't he?	he's is also a contraction of "he has" and it is found in the oxford dictionary. Slender is really the only grammatical error that I can find in the sentence as it is used out of contex for the subject.	1

Real fun with the racing begins from Saturday! However, Jamiroquoi concert is at the circuit on Friday after the practice session. I'm a little confused.

Hi guys, Seems lot of people has been trapped by this company. They have lured the people by promising accommodation in 5 star hotels with special rate which seems all fake. How many of QL members are affected - let us count- and if we are sufficient then we can think of something. I am one of them.	1

I have also became the member of Vacation International, I have paid around 6300QR out of total contract value (18000QR)but after reading the online complaints about this travel agency, I am not able to take decision either to cancel the contract or go ahead. I have to pay remaining amount in installments (340QR /month). If I have to cancel the contract I will loose 40% of contract value (i.e. 7200QR). It is true that they don't have any website, and they have informed the the website is under construction. Also there are complaints about this travel agency in Dubai. If anybody know more about this travel agency, please share.	1

Dear Don2 nothing more to share you are already trapped and me too. i have paid 4700 for 6 nights in any of the coutry from the list. and two weeks in sharmalsheikh free according to them but its not free they have already charged the full rent in 4700 with meals again they will sell meal coupons for 140 each person. so if u stay sh shk for two weeks you have to pay almost 5000 more for food which you have alredy paid. only thing you can get back from them is 6 nights in malaysia which cost max 1200. but to get it back you have to pay 6000 for tickets for two. its absolutly horrible deal i have made in my life. and still they are so shameless people saying alhamdullillah and they are muslims etc etc.if you want to sve money dont pay installments i did not pay and my loss is still at 4700.	1

Is there anyone who can shed light on this.. how exactly do they cheat us? did anyone actually use their offer and stay at their hotels? All those who claim to be victimized why exactly do you feel so? have you tried to cancel the contract? then do they make you pay the 40% as stated in the contract?	0

How would you compare Qatar to UAE? Just wondering because they said UAE is an open city...	I lived in Dubai for a year (2006-2007) and I still go there every 2-3 weeks on business. Dubai is definitely the place to be. It is as expensive as Doha, but atleast there are a million things to do, social life is amazing, they have a proper infrastructure in place, things happen in Dubai, unlike Doha. The d-ring and industrial roundabout have been closed for a very long time here. In the same time, Dubai has built roads, bridges and highways to wrap Doha several times over. Construction boom in Doha? You got to be kidding! Check out the real boom in Dubai. Career opportunities? Dubai of course. Lifestyle and going out? Dubai. Having fun? Dubai. Driving? Dubai of course. Everything else? Dubai. So why am I here? Not for long... as soon as I can, I am moving back.	1
How would you compare Qatar to UAE? Just wondering because they said UAE is an open city...	Compared to Doha, Dubai has: More nightclubs and nightlife. More nationalities, less locals. More buildings. More Business/Trade. Extremely bad traffic (Qatar's traffic is getting just as bad). Bizarrely Dubai's Internet services are more restrictive (I noticed flickr and skype are banned there!). I don't know which of these are better or worse, you be the judge.	1
I am a Canadian living in Qatar, and my RP just expired (in the process of renewal). I just got off the phone with Emirates and Qatar Airways, both said that I will not be eligible for an on-arrival visa unless my Qatari RP has been valid for 3 months. Any way around this? What if I apply "properly" in advance? Of course they gave me a telephone number, and of course nobody answered. Anybody going through this? More info would be great!	you do need to have a valid RP	1

Canandian whom are residents of the GCC country can still get Visa on Arrival in UAE. Both Emirate and QA are correct that you should renew your Resident permit to avail that free of charge visa on arrival. Plus you cannot leave Qatar without an exit permit, which can only be issued if you cancel your RP or have a valid RP. So simply you need to expedite the renewal of your RP. Khallas	1

Hey African guys, would you support me if I opened an Afican eating place and African food shop here in Doha?	Almost all the bigger restaurants in Qatar are multicuisine as it will be difficult to push through if they are selling only food of a particular nation. You will not find too many South Africans here and those who are here will be eating from the well known restaurants. My suggestion is to open your restaurant with multicuisine with your speciality of South African Food.	1

Apart from obvious things like pork, are we able to bring food to Qatar? Specifically, dried food like Malaysian anchovies (ikan bilis) and Chinese Mushrooms. We have a fairly large stock in New Zealand, and don't want to waste it........ What a pity that I'll have to drink the cellar dry before I leave   Cheers, Tom 	Hi Tom, ikan bilis here is not the same you can get back in Malaysia, try to bring yours..and some extras for me too...

1) How is the driving license rule? we can take driving license on the family visit visa or Business visit visa? I have a Indian driving license.	Your license is Indian national not inter national. Yes you can get license provided you pass the test. For some countries they allow without test but you are not from one of those countries. Also GCC valid license holders need to just exchange their license for a fee. You may have to take a minimum driving course from a driving school. But even direct test is possible if you get approval from Captain at Traffic Depot.	1

I am under husbands sponsorship, Are we (my husband and I)going to undergo the medical processing for the renewal of VISA?	OH MY GOD ... You people are giving her the wrong information!!!!! Medical exam IS REQUIRED for extension of family visit visa. (this is what I did for my family) The requirement states: If the visitor wants to stay more than one month inside the country, he/ she has to undergo a medical test before the month ends. The visa is renewable for five months for immediate family (father, mother, sister, sons) and two months for other relations. Get the official requirement here from Hukoomi website: 1. Go to Hukoomi. (you can google it) 2. Go to How do I? 3. Select get residence visa for family 4. On the next page, click on "for more information, click here" 5. On list of services, click on "Visas for Family Visits" Hope this helps and do your medical (at the Medical Commission) soonest. Don't forget to do the blood grouping first.	1

Hello, I need to get health insurance for my wife. I'm covered by my company's insurance, but she is not. I have read about something called "government health card", which seems to cost QR100 per person per year. Would be grateful for info on how this works, and where she can apply. She is currently on a tourist visa, since our family visa is still being processed (I got my RP very recently). Can she still apply for insurance, or would she have to get the family visa first?	You need to have a RP to be eligible to appy for a health card. Until u get the rp you will have to rely on private clinics, Appolo and Al Ahli are good private hospitals.	1

Once you get an RP you can apply for a health card that is like a social security number allowing you to access the National Health Service. It is a great service, clean and modern in my opinion. In case of emergency, you do not have to have a health card, they will still treat you.	1

Your wife must have her RP before plying for a Health Card. Yes you do not need a Health Card in an Emergency. HMC service is good.

Health Card for Insurrance, After taking an RP, go to Health Center where you can take a health card, 100 Qr if you don't have an ID Card, 50Qr if you have an ID. You have to bring pp copy, three photo, and pay the fee, you will collect the Health Card after 1 month, but you can use the receipt as a proof and you can use as wherever you need it.  " There's nothing we can do to change the past, if it teaches  you a lesson profit from it then, forget it."	1

No, as far as I know she has to have her own RP first. I had a back problem when I first arrived and because my husband was going to sponsor me when his RP came through, they sent me through as an emergency as I wouldn't be able to get a routine appointment without an HMC number. That was a few years ago so if anyone knows different please correct me.	1

I have read about something called "government health card", which seems to cost QR100 per person per year. Would be grateful for info on how this works, and where she can apply. She is currently on a tourist visa, since our family visa is still being processed (I got my RP very recently). Can she still apply for insurance, or would she have to get the family visa first?	jasmine is right, she needs to have her RP first. and the health card is not an "insurance", as jasmine pointed out it is for you to have an access to the country's national health service that is being offered to the locals and expats as well.	1

Hello everyone!!! Im soon arriving at Doha (hopefully sooner than I think). I wanted to raise the question: Is it safe to bycicle around Doha? I don´t want to go through the whole process to get a driving permit, so...I thought I could buy a bycicle. Since Im not really that interested in having a car and on the other hand It´s quite healthy. What do you think guys? Is it safe and practical to cycle around Doha?	its not quiet safe to ride a bicycle around doha due to reckless drivers...but sometimes u can go n try on highways..i hav seen many bicycle riders riding on alkhor highway	1

You might want to use your bike as recreation, but definitely not as transportation. You will see when you get here, you need a car to get around - roads here are really not built with cyclists in mind, and most of other drivers have zero respect and tolerance for anything with less than 4 wheels. Believe me, you will want to have a driving license. :(	1

Riding a bicycle in 50+C weather is a real downer too. It's hot (really hot) here for about 6 months of the year. Bicycle riders are viewed as an obstacle by 99% of drivers and as a target in many cases. It is not safe.	1

I know somebody who's using his bike to and fro his office. He's really into biking though, so he knows how to be on the safe side, but I think luck plays a bigger part here.

I am Pakistani national Can you Help	I'm sorry you failed 3 times but there is no other way to get a license than to pass the test. I failed once and then I took to driving classes (short course) just to know what they are looking for on the road test and also mainly because we do not have a lot of roundabouts back in our country. I found out that they are particular about your car's position before approaching a roundabout when you are going right, left or straight. Try to go into a short course to bring up your confidence.	1

Can i apply for direct driving test without joining driving class as i got Indian Driving licence? whats the procedure and documents required with fees? please suggest.	Yes ! you can ....I got mine in the same way !! But wait ..consider joining atleast a short or half course ..Getting a DL is difficult now & mostly you will fail if you do not have experience driving in the GCC or US / UK. Rather than wasting money by failing in direct test . Join a course. Because if you fail 2-3 times in direct test you will be approximately wasting about 1500qr in test fee, rent car on test day, taxi travel to & fro.	0

Non-Filipinos will not understand what you mean by your question. But I am Filipino, and i do know what you mean. Middle East driving license is honored in our country. if you're going there for vacation, you can use Qatar license. but if you're staying in Phils for good, then you must get a student's license for a month, then convert it to non-pro afterwards. good luck.	1

But I would like to get one when I go home, do I still need to get a students license before getting the non-pro license?	i just came from vacation. i went to LTO regarding this one. you just need to present your Qatari License card there and you need to pay some amount and you'll need to undergo drug testing and after that you'll just wait for your Phil license (non pro only) if you'll apply for Porfessional license you'll have to undergo written and actual testing. also you can use your Qatari Drivers License for 3 months but make sure you will bring your passport with you while driving because in case you had an accident you need to present the arrival date if it is still under 3 months and that you are having your vacation there. better yet to apply for RP license so that you wont be worrying about your Qatari Drivers license.	1

Hi, Iam an asian expatriate resident of qatar.

Hi, Iam an asian expatriate resident of qatar. How long will it take to obtain visa to visit UK, is it a long process until we succeed getting visa or how easy it is and what are the formalities? tks & rgds,	as per experience, ot takes about 3 to 5 days for them to release the visa/results. If it's your first time, you can download the form from the VSF link above, or as what we do, we download and fill up a draft copy and then fill out the actual form in the VSF office. It's a loooong form :D Better go first thing in the morning since there's less queue. Bring all requirements listed, including: letter from company stating your salary/position and tenure official bank statement (6 mos i think) your work visa passport picture marriage contract (in case ur bringing wife) and some other (just pls dbl check in the website) Always bring the original + photocopy when you get there, after filling up the forms, they will gather all your documents and put it in a sealed envelope -- everything will be couriered to UK in 24 hrs and even the result is sealed when u get it back, so the VSF people do not really have a say on the results. btw, they will also get your fingerprints and picture and signature, all digital. Payment is about 400QR for 6 mos visit visa. Goodluck!	1

Do US citizens living in Qatar for longer than 11 months a year and paid through a Qatari bank still have to fill out tax forms and send them to the USA, or can one simply forget about the IRS and not worry about it? If so, is there a maximum salary exemption and does one have to include housing and other perks? Thanks for your help! I hope I can kiss the IRS goodbye!	Yeah right! They will hunt us down until the day we die and probably even after that. Here's a few things from the IRS site. You (and I) really need to ask a professional because it's tricky and I really don't know what to do. I have read something else before about living out of the country for all but 30 days of the year and that being one of the reasons for exemption but I can't find the exact wording... http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=97324,00.html If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien living or traveling outside the United States, you generally are required to file income tax returns, estate tax returns, and gift tax returns and pay estimated tax in the same way as those residing in the United States. Your income, filing status, and age generally determine whether you must file a return. Generally, you must file a return if your gross income from worldwide sources is at least the amount shown for your filing status in the Filing Requirements table in Chapter 1 of Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to $82,400 of your foreign earnings. In addition, you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts.	0

If so, is there a maximum salary exemption and does one have to include housing and other perks? Thanks for your help! I hope I can kiss the IRS goodbye!	Here's something else. Let me know if you do talk to a professional because right now I've been operating on the "ignorance-is-bliss" philosophy which isn't that smart! Significant Penalty Imposed for Not Filing Expatriation Form The Internal Revenue Service reminds practitioners that anyone who has expatriated or terminated his U.S. residency status must file Form 8854, Initial and Annual Expatriation Information Statement (PDF). Form 8854 must also be filed to comply with the annual information reporting requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 6039G, if the person is subject to tax under Section 877 of the Code. A $10,000 penalty may be imposed for failure to file Form 8854 when required. IRS is sending notices to expatriates that have not complied with the Form 8854 requirements, including the imposition of the $10,000 penalty where appropriate. The Instructions for Form 8854 (PDF) provide details about the filing requirements, related definitions and line-by-line instructions for completing the form. Failure to file or not including all the information required by the form or including incorrect information could lead to a penalty.	0

I often think that I will never live in the US again. But I still have family there and one day (not soon I hope) I will inherit property. One way or another the IRS will get me. The only way I can get out of it is to give up my US citizenship. So after a long time of not filing, I did. I did a deal with the IRS and paid up!	0

Do US citizens living in Qatar for longer than 11 months a year and paid through a Qatari bank still have to fill out tax forms and send them to the USA, or can one simply forget about the IRS and not worry about it? If so, is there a maximum salary exemption and does one have to include housing and other perks? Thanks for your help! I hope I can kiss the IRS goodbye!	The short answer is yes you have to file. It would probably be a good idea to get a reputable accounting firm to do them. I use one in Saudi. Price Waterhouse	1

I'm interested in the issue of multiple exit visas. Is this option open to citizens of any nationality so long as you have your employer's approval, or is it just for UK/US employees or UK/US based employers? Does anyone know the cost to the employer of a multiple-exit visa? Is there any government web site describing the conditions and fine print on this type of exit visa? (I went looking at moi.gov.qa and couldn't find any meaningful information myself.) Thanks.	I believe it is open to all. Primarily, it is for use by those that need to enter and exit the country on a regular basis, irrespective of nationality.	1

Only Love & Respect of Others Makes us Human. --------------------------------------------- I work for QP and needed/ still need such multiple/ re-entry visa to take care of my folks on emergency basis. I requested once the HR department, but was given no reply :-) I offered to pay for it, cancel my credit card. I do not have any company or bank loans either. I enjoyed this status in Saudi. Six months multiple re-entry/ exit without any problem for SR500. It’s just unfortunate to find this out only after we moved. I do not know whom to turn to? I only pray at this time.

Yes I see what you said but if QP can issue a single exit permit within hours why the multiple exit visa requirement.

Did the emergency system in place not work? If so, I can draw attention to that fact with QP. I am sure the HR Management would be very concerned if the system had failed to work and would implement steps to remedy that . I personally did my stint on 24/7 for just that reason when I was in QP and we managed to get people out on emergency within hours, even when we were bleeped in the wee small hours. The permits are already stamped and just need filling in.	1

Hi,I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?	Without a man you can travel anywhere inside Doha. Yes! it is not like America, very safe country. Nobody steal from you anything, it's 100% guarantee. Also, out of Qatar you can travel. But, you need EXIT PERMIT. Yes, even a MAN from Mass need Exit Permit once need to go out of Qatar. You are just an Amarican lady only.	1

Hi,I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?	it depends on your visa. If you entered Qatar with the Vsit Visa, ou don't need an exit permit. If you came on Business Visa and stay LESS than 1 month, you still do not need a visa. If you came on Business Visa and stay more than 1 month, you will need an Exit permit. And if you have an RP here, you will DEFINITELY need an exit permit from your sponsor, unless you are under your husband's sponsorship. Whoever say "Lady's do not need an exit permit", have no clue what they are saying...again, all depends on your status here	1
Hi,I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?	yeah, and exit permit can be done in 3 minutes over the internet if your sponsor has an internet access to it. otherwise it takes few hours.	1

Do you want to go home? or you want to stay and work here? I don't get you. But anyway, if your business visa is expiring first time (meaning you are in Qatar less than 30 days), and you have to leave the country, you don't need an exit permit. Check your ticket, may be it has return flight. Just go to the airport and leave. If not, ask your company what they are planning for you. we cannot know here what your company's arrangment is. To send you home? to extend your visa? to issue work visa and RP for you? ask your manager.	1

if not married how does the girlfriend of a person living and working in Doha get a visa? i b elieve this is done on entry and is only valid for 3/4 weeks?? how does she get this visa and what does she need to get it... money documents ect??	As far as i know, that is not so difficult.  If you know any mandoub, ask him for help and explain that you want to sponsor someone not related to you. Even your travel agent can arrange for it.  Al Deera is one example.  They can book you in Al Maha Services at the airport.  They will provide everything from visa processing up to clearing at immigration here at the airport. You have to check if her nationality is among those who are being granted visa at the airport. Examples are: ·         USA ·         Greece ·         France ·         Germany ·         Sweden ·         Italy   If not, then you have to process at least 3 days prior to her departure.	1

I've posted alot of info on visas, but to put it short, it depends where she's from. I see from your profile that you're from the UK so I can say that it's VERY easy to get a visa. In fact, she gets it on arrival at the airport if she's British. It's usually a month in duration. __________________________ &lt;-- Cost of Living, Visas, Safety Info, Tips, Pics, Vids and m	1

Anybody has met the Commitee members or Captain, once the Family Residence Visa is rejected ? If so can you share your experience ? I mean what they will ask us in the meeting. What are all the possible ways to get approval from them ? Did you went in the Morning or Evening to meet them ? Anybody got approval after meeting them in the appointment date ? Please share it, it will be very much useful for others whoever want to live with their family. Thanks in advance.	You can search here ... Its mentioned more than 1000 times.. We also got our application rejected and thrice we met the captain ... every month we met in the hope that it will be approved but no use... and at last one of my friend suggested to call up this guy at 66537722 to seek help, and he got it approved for us.	1

Thanks in advance.	you could set appointment by bringing the copy of receipt and then they will put the date and time on it. in my case, the appointment was set 1 month after I requested for the meeting. so many reasons why application is rejected. if they have problem on your papers they will tell you, if that can still be supported by providing other documents, then they might put the status under "postpone" while waiting for your other papers. They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected. Just my advice, they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family, even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here. Good luck	1

Few people says like, they wont approve it, no use in meeting the captain, just go through some intermediate person or call this number. Are they say this to us to go through intermediate person, so that they will get the commision like that. If it is some minimal amount means we can bare it. But when I call those numbers they are asking blindly 10000 QAR to 17000 QAR to get the Visa approved. They dont know the value of the money, simply misguiding the peoples to loose the money. Please put your valuable experience, whoever faced the issue like me.	0

So if I am understanding correcting Vala, one needs to work in Qatar at least 6months to apply for a family visa? And if yes, is there any way for a family to come on a visitor visa then switch it? Thanks!	0

Hi Friends i have same issue like Mr.Shibik said. already my wife's resident visa status "Application is Rejected" and family visit visa completing 6month in 20Nov. My Question is while we meeting the captain, he will explain missing documents / details or he simply check our body language and appearance???? i was submitted Mr.valappil88 listed document(1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11 & 12) + my Engg. degree certificate (attested, translated) copy and only one missed thing is i didn't get baladiya attestation in tenancy contract.	1

Hi, The documents that you did not submit is an important one...that is why your family visa is not approved. So no meaning to blame them...first make sure your part is correct...then only blame them.	1

Dear Mr.Valappil88, i heard a rumor last month, baladiya stamp in tenancy agreement document is withheld due to many family visa rejections by immigration. then i submitted my documents. the doc. receiving counter also not commented about this baladiya stamp issue. i was happy while they given receipt for visa processing. after a week days i shocked to see this bad result. now i am waiting for "Lajna meeting". i hope they will accept my new tenancy contract with baladiya stamp from another landlord.	1
Hello and Good morning to all! I would just like to ask if I can change my husband and children's tourist visa into a family visit visa? I brought my family here in Qatar on a tourist visa and I am hoping to change them to a family visit visa before their tourist visa expires. Will somebody please give me an option what to do? I have read from this site that migs 1296 was able to convert his wife visa from tourist to family visit visa. I don't know how to contact him.. Please help	The only way for you to transfer them to family visit is by exiting the country, and coming back using the Family Visit Visa. there is no such transfer, but you can transfer it into "husband or Father" sponsorship. Visit visa, they need to exit, have their existing visit visa be cancelled, and enter with the new one. this way, they have maximum stay of 6 months. It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare, it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	1

You can't just sponsor them yourself even though you have an RP you still need your company to grant you permission first and depending what type of sponsorship you have will depend on whether you are eligible or not.

I am about to give a months notice and will be leaving Qatar. I have no debt on my credit card but someone has said that as soon as i resign my account will be frozen to cover the credit limit of the credit card - is this the case? Also presuming i dont leave enough cash in my account to cover the credit limit during the freeze period (assuming this is longer than 1 month), will I be able to exit the country? How will I be able to access this cash once I leave? Any help appreciated.	Your work will ask you for a list of clearances, including one from the bank. That's the holdup, you will have to leave some money, and you have to workout a transfer after the freez period, no joy at all. Alternative, you can have a guarantor and avoid all of that, talk to the bank for such an option.	1

Go to the bank, close your credit card account and ask for a clearance that you shall be providing your company, that's all you have to do!	1

They will of course charge for it but it is always worth. No one in future can claim any thing based on past cards / loan and keep you away from legal hassle.	1

If you have no dues pending, go to the Bank and get all your cards(debit/credit) cancelled, bank accounts closed and ask for the Bank to give you a no dues/clearance certificate.	1

can anyone advise me reagarding kadama visa,we already applied the visa it is on process now maybe by next week it will be ready..now my question is if i will bring my filipina nanny here by visit visa can i transfer her visa to kadama or bussiness visa will do?because if i will send the documents thru agency it will take time to process and it will cost me for sure a lot of money, and for how long the transfering of visit or business visa will take?	Bring her over under visit visa first then when your visa is ready for her to transfer just go to Immigration and they will put the visa under her name. no problem even you brought her over under visit visa it's even better than kadama visa straight away because she has to go through lots of processing in our end. this is what we normally do nowadays to avoid all the long procesing. Good luck!	1

But maybe the much spending is cause I have a wife who likes to cook for the whole neighborhood :( To answer the question of how much it cost, it depends on the person n the family. I have a friend with a wife n 4 kids who always brags about spending no more than 1000 a month on all groceries. But that's done by waking up at 5 AM n driving to the industrial area or the farms to buy the veggies n meat n the waterfront to buy fish. For me, nothing worth waking up at 5 AM but if u can do that then huge savings can be made :)	1

If he is well qualified and experienced then I will say that the oofer is too low. BTW, There are lots of people working here even for lesser salary.

Hopefully they will get it right and make proper habitats for the animals instead of the awfully small cages they had before. Hope they also raise awareness toward animal treatment--- ie. ban the practice of letting children harass, improperly feed, and hit the animals.	1

Hi, Can somebody please tell me if there is a zoo in Qatar, with monkeys? Regards	Drive up Salwa Road towards the Industrial Area. Turn right at the castle roundabout. The zoo is about 600 m on your right. Enjoy watching the animals feeding the animals!	1

Hi, Can somebody please tell me if there is a zoo in Qatar, with monkeys? Regards	If you like animals then do not go to the zoo. It is absolutely horrific. The animals are malnourished and kept in cages way to small. I think it should be shut down. I brought my girlfriend there for a date and i was a huge mistake. I almost cried. This is coming from someone who was in Iraq for 13 months. It is depressing and I think that it would be best for you to avoid this attraction. Unless you hate animals... then have at it.

Hi, Can somebody please tell me if there is a zoo in Qatar, with monkeys? Regards	Not so bad for you maybe, but what about the poor animals locked in cages. Aisha, how can anyone enjoy an outing seeing malnourished animals locked in small cages? Regardless, all zoos are cruel, and the idea that people enjoy "family outings" at zoo's for their own entertainment is just sick. Unless like David said, you hate animals. Poor animals :(	0
Hi, Can somebody please tell me if there is a zoo in Qatar, with monkeys? Regards	I am Scorpion too.. You are very right, i am agree with you that Animals never be treated like Humans treated in Abu Ghuraib Jail (Iraq),Qandhar Jail (Afghanistan), Guantanamo Bay (Cuba)etc. There must be some respect for Animals as they are not human too. I promise i'll never go to zoo again and never support the activity which cause the elimination of any freedom. We have to must think about the freedom of human also.

Hi, Can somebody please tell me if there is a zoo in Qatar, with monkeys? Regards	Wellll, then it's not about QATAR zoo.. you're talking zoos in general. Of course it's unfair to lock them in cages..

Hi, Can somebody please tell me if there is a zoo in Qatar, with monkeys? Regards	Yes,I realise he wasn't asking that. This is a forum..ummm...freedom of speech... I was voicing my opinion. Qatar zoo, like David said is terrible. I just cant understand how anyone can enjoy themselves seeing animals in cages and saying "I like the zoo". Dont mean to offend, I'm just very sensitive towards human and animal rights. I agree with you sfd24, there should be respect for all creatures, humans and animals....it is terrible what is happening in those prisons. :( peace xx	0

Do they need to duplicate it on the new passport or can I just carry old and new passport together when traveling? Does anyone know?	my passport just expired this month and my working visa was on it. but before the expiration date, i happen to renewed the thing last month and also did inform our office about it. According to them... Yes, they have to transfer your qatari visa to your new passport, which it did happen to me and our liason officer asked 50 riyals for it...... Only in qatar they do that or middle east...,,, i guess. co'z i've worked in other countries like brunei and even singapore,they dont do that, they just staple your new and old passport together without transerring the visa to your new passport and during traveling, immigration officers just ask about the old passport.it's a different system they have.......anyway, i hope this info will help you.... <fo	1

Cygnet – when did you have to renew your passport? Was it a long time ago? Do you still travel with old and new passport together? Scorpio – do you remember how long it took to get the visa duplicated on your new passport? Does it take ages as usual or is it a quick and smooth process?	0

My advice give plenty of time spare when you change your visa to new passport ... make sure you not arranging your new trip till you get your passport + visa document sorted	1

If you get all teh documents from your sponsor yourself and submit them personally at Visa office in Madina Khalifa, it normally takes 3-5 days. However, if you are working in a Q company like QP, QAFCO, QAPCO etc. you must give about 3-4 weeks for the process to complete since the HR people in these companies are lazy, lethargic and downright incompetent.	1

Do they need to duplicate it on the new passport or can I just carry old and new passport together when traveling? Does anyone know?	When you send your old passport to get renewed, they will attach both of them the new and the old. When you get them back just go to the immigration and they will cancel both, the old passport and old visa and issue you a new visa with the same details of the old one. Don't worry about it, should take nothing more than 5 minutes to print the new visa and stick it on the new passport. Looks like I was late in posting this, I was in Sealine and come before a while .. :)	1

Hello Everyone: I parked car outside mall the other day in late evening and next morning I discovered there is a 2 feet long scratch on right side of the car. I did not notice before as i left from left side of car (from diriving seat) and came back same way. Now, should I check if someone has already reported this incident and how can I check it? What afterwards would be required to get the claim from insurance? Thanks and Regards	(before oct 2nd) ... they have new law now. The normal procedures to report to the police exactly what happend. They will then ask you to return in 2 weeks. Hence given time for the other party to report. If no one report ... you can get the police letter / certificate, with that you can go to the garage to get it fix (via insurance). Not too sure what is the right procedure after getting a letter from the police.	1

I was told the one close to landmark is the main one. I am not sure if it happened in mall or outside mosque as i noticed in morning only after reaching at work. And on my way to work, i stopped-by at bank as well so not sure really where it really happened.	0

The police will just look at the damage make a report and ask you to put a QR5/- stamp. Thats all you just take the paper and go to any garage of your choice. Other wise you may have to wait for a few days sometimes as less as 3 and after that they will give you the report. I think if you are going to claim insurance then you need to pay QR 100/- at the traffic dept I think before they give you the paper to take to the insurance company.	1

I'm not saying OP damaged their own car, but just curious. I didn't think the 2/10 laws coming in changed accident procedures in that way. I thought it was traffic safety stuff which got changed. Or that's how it sounded in the newspaper, anyway.	0

No any other branch will accept your report. 2. You will be asked to after 2 weeks to collect the report. 3. Collect the report and go to your insurance co. 4. They will inspect your car and take picutes and endorse your police report immediatly. 5. With that go to the dearlers workshop or workshop of your choice. (I would recommend you to got to the dealer's workshop.)	1

Thanks?	I had the exact same thing happen on Salwa road here with a large truck with no mudflaps behind its wheels kicking up rocks into my windshield and cracked it. I took the # plate down and gave it to my insurance company. I paid the deductible and my insurance paid for the rest of the replacement costs. FWIW, back home in the US (varies by state) it is mandatory the insurance company replaces the windshield with any cracks in it at no cost! It is a huge safety hazard driving around with a broken windshield.	1

Thanks?	As someone else has said here, can you imagine if everyone claimed for cracked windows? It would be chaos for insurance firms. Just take your car to a autoglass shop and have it fixed - its NOT AN ACCIDENT.	1

Thanks?	I can understand your speed must have been high or else the impact wouldn't have been so damaging. Its the relative speed which matters. Technically, its your car that hit the stone :-/ But seriously, its a rare case and you can't really have a police report in your favour. Check with the insurance if they would pay a part of it.	1

So you recommend I ask my insurance first?	0

Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	contact the bank i question	1
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	I had to do this one time.   I simply called the bank and they took the necessary info over the phone and handled it.  Of course here in Qatar it will probably not be as easy.   Go to the bank and talk to the customer service people.	1
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	Thanks.  Actually, i just want to know if they do it differently in other banks like CBQ, QNB, Doha Bank, Standard Chartered, etc. I have my account with HSBC. I just have a problem with my landlord, as they already asked us to vacate the house. Now, i still have a cheque as a deposit and he still hasn't returned it to me.  So i went to the bank and asked them to cancel the payment for that cheque. Guess what, they said they can't do that unless i go to the police first and get a report.  Weird for something like this.  That is my account and i should have the prerogative to cancel the payment.  It is my problem if somebody tries to cash the cheque and finds out it has been cancelled, right?	0
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	the reason for the police report is so if your landlord should present the cheque you will not be held responsible and no action can be taken against you.	0
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	The customer service representative said for whatever reason i want to stop the payment, i have to get a police report.	0
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	If someone writes a cheque knowing that there are no funds to cover it, they will be arrested. This is why the bank asks for a police report; mostly for their protection, but a little bit for yours too. "You can't tell which way the train went by looking at the tracks"	1
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	What the police report is for is should your landlord present the cheque (out of malice) is negaite you from the responsiblity. If you stop the cheque without the police report or by not having the money in the account then you are the person responsible and it means that you can be arrested and detained by the police till you make the payment. so your land lord wins if you go to the police present your case and get the report to present to the bank then should your landlord present the cheque then you have done nothing wrong and he cannot claim the money and wont be able to claim the money and you won't end up in jail.	1
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	You have to go to the police and file a claim, and get the police report that is the right way, if you don't he can cash the cheques any time and you can proove nothing. so you are right.	1
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	go to the rents committee and tell them the situation, they should contact the landlord and instruct him to return the same. That is if you want to avoid the police course of action	1
Does anybody here know how to stop a payment for a cheque issued? CBQ, QNB, etc...	Thanks for the info guys. But the remaining cheque that he has is a deposit only, which he has to return to me at the end of the contract.  Everything is in order at the house and we even spent money to make major repairs.  We haven't failed to pay our rent every 1st of the month for one year. so it just right taht they return my deposit to me. it's just strange for me how it is done here, i guess	0

Better go on tuesday/wednsday, coz the other days must be crowded. they will make some basic medical checkup + Xray.. and you will receive the result on spot (soniya is wrong, that few days is for RP medical).	1

Yes Insha'Allah you meet the minimum requirement which is 7000qr and you have already been here 2 years so it should be quite straight forward for you to apply for your daughter. Please go to this link www.gov.qa . Click on "apply for family visa" it will tell you all the criteria and explain the procedure. You may also download the application form from that site. All the best.	1

Opening this matter to your HR/ mandoob will put you in trouble....kal_el made a point. 3. Think and ask wisely to your HR/ mandoob, means you are not the subject but your friend.

A quick response will be highly appreciated Thankyou Shamseera	de ja vu .... didnt u post this sometimes back. To go to Hamad Hospital you will need a health card in order to obtain a treatment. And in order to obtain a health card you will need a copy of your RP. if you really want to deliver in Qatar ... i guess you will have to go private like Al  Ahli or doha Clinic.

If you cant find any here, go to the lite and easy website and you can construct your own menu, as they have the layout of what they send out to clients...I did this 7 months ago and lost 10 kilos in two months(with no excercise) and it didnt feel like a diet as i was eating three meals a day with morn/afternoon/evening snack and all meals included bread...there was so much to eat that most days i didnt everything recommended. With diets its not so much how often you eat but just the amount (portion control) and the type of food.  Its also about managing to eat food that you like(apart from junk) so you can continue to eat healthy every day.	1

Does anyone know of a supplier here in Qatar? I know there is one in Dubai, but I am guessing that food products (which of course they are) will be difficult to import. Yes I also know there are plenty of alternatives, and I have tried loads before. The Cambridge Diet is the one I want to try next ;)	Ok before any more well intentioned eating and exercise tips start arriving. Let me point out that I leave home at 6:20 in the morning, and don't get back home until 8:30 in the evening. Cooking is out of the question, and all I want to do is fall into bed so exercise is out as well. The Cambridge Diet uses convientient, safe and efective products that I can fit into my day, and have great results. That is why I am looking for a supplier here. Heck if I can't find one I may even find a Qatari to start a company importing the stuff.	0

It was developed in 1970 by Dr. Alan Howard at Cambridge University, United Kingdom as a method of rapidly shedding weight while reducing loss of lean body weight. The core principle of the diet is severe calorie restriction, as low as 400 calories/day, combined with supplements of minerals, vitamins and fatty acids to reduce the loss of nutrients typical of severe calorie restriction. However, experts note that some essential nutrients may still be lost, leading to potential problems such as heart arrythmias and other side effects. As a result, it is claimed that the diet in its original form has contributed to a number of deaths." read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_Diet	0

It has been reported in todays Khaleej times that one of the benefits of circumscision is to curb the spread of Aids. How many agree with this?	I was a bit bemused at first, however, here it is in full. It seems to suggest circumcision may cut down AIDS in a heterosexual relationship, although I can't quite see how! Maybe the 'infection' doesn't get stuck anywhere. oh ugh - I'm going. http://khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticleNew.asp?section=theworld&xfile=data/theworld/2007/july/theworld_july625.xml Good article and World Health make comments too, but can't cope with it at this time of night. cheers!	1

It has been reported in todays Khaleej times that one of the benefits of circumscision is to curb the spread of Aids. How many agree with this?	According to the little information I know, circumcised means less friction. Guess thats why they are relating it to cutting down down. I am coming from a country with various religions. For Muslims, as well as the Jews, it is compulsory and usually it is done within a month from birth. But I remember that some Christian guys were circumcised when they are old for hygienic reasons. I don't know what is involved in "hygienic" and never asked. Ladies please do not read the following story. A Christian friend of mine told me an incident that happened to his relative (a male) and they made fun out of it. Usually, our culture is that the girl should be virgin. SO that guy on his wedding night and while doing his "duties" had that "annex" removed due to the incident and wrong meneuvers and started bleeding. His relatives and friends started saying that instead of the bride loosing her virginity, it ended up that the groom lost his virginity. Now you can read the remaining part ladies. Regards	1
It has been reported in todays Khaleej times that one of the benefits of circumscision is to curb the spread of Aids. How many agree with this?	circumcision is a must!, I can't believe other people and in most places do not do this practice. well... Research studies indicate that there are good medical reasons why your son should be circumcised. These include: * Circumcision substantially reduces an infant´s chances of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) during the first year of his life. Although the rate of urinary tract infections for infants is not very high (around xxx %), UTI´s are becoming increasingly difficult to treat (see here for a discussion). * Cancer of the penis - that effects xxx men in a thousand - is essentially eliminated in circumcised males. * Research shows that males who are circumcised have a lower risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, partners of circumcised males are less likely to contract vaginal infections (e.g. yeast infections). * Circumcision eliminates foreskin infections that occur throughout childhood. * Circumcision prevents phimosis, a narrow opening that makes it impossible to retract the foreskin at a later age. * Genital hygiene is easier after circumcision. * Circumcision virtually eliminates the accumulation of smegma.	1
It has been reported in todays Khaleej times that one of the benefits of circumscision is to curb the spread of Aids. How many agree with this?	I enjoyed your friend's story, I had a little tale in mind when I first saw this thread so now feel more confident to tell you all. I worked with a Jewish firm in London (terrific sense of humour against themselves). Anyway, one day they were discussing another Jew in the same company who they didn't like very much and I nearly died laughing when they said: "Yeah - when they circumcised him they threw the wrong bit away." Gotta love it!	0

It has been reported in todays Khaleej times that one of the benefits of circumscision is to curb the spread of Aids. How many agree with this?	Forgive me for being so dumb but I don't get the story about the Christian guy. Do you mean he knocked on the wrong foor and suffered some injury? I don't know much about circumsion. For those of us born in the United States in the 1960s it was normal procedure for all male babies and was done within days of birth. I was one of those babies and it never occurred to me to ask why it was done. In my case, not for religious reasons as I am not Muslim or Jewish. Since I have always been circumcised I don't know what the alternative is like. Maybe the ladies have a view on this. Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary.

WHY IN OTHERS RELIGION,CIRCUMSIZED IS FORBIDDEN? [mod note - moved to religion section]	im no einstein, but in other cultures it's answered plainly coz its not necessary. religion wise, i think in general, its forbidden coz it's considered for them aesthetics which is not allowed. simply put in layman's terms..like tattoos are forbidden, its not allowed to put silicone in your humps, so as its forbidden to cut that foreskin in you shaft. for them it's considered unnecessary. if its not necessary its vanity. vanity is a no-no.	1

I am sure you can find someone running ink here in Doha. Just ask around the pinoy community, they will know. You need to be careful of who is around when you talk about it, as you see from most of the replies above these closed minded people think this is their personal viewpoint site. And they may take it upon themselves to rat you out . I would question the overall sanitary conditions of any illigal opperation here in doha.

It's not about anyone's personal views, its illegal here. You can't blame someone who isn't ready to tolerate it that you break the law. You have to take the blame on yourself for breaking or trying to break the law in the first place. Just cos its legal where you came from doesn't make it acceptable behavior here.	1

Can anyone recommend any General Medical Service provider at Al Ahli Hospital? Share of a personal experience? Do they have any Women focused service?

But we have taken our son there before and found it to be fantastic. Its run by Aus Health International (Australia) and  all the doctors we have met speak very good english and give very good care.

Any lady doctor that speaks clear/ fluent English? Do they have full coverage for Al-Koot insurance? Any experience with insurance? Thanks for all your help.	I think Dr. Sujatha is still there (Gynecologist), she's ok and communicates very well. You need to go thru primary network as speed says (i.e. apollo clinic where i work hahaha and tell to dr. sujatha uv been referred by lowel) to secure a referral. Anyway, Al Ahli is an excellent hospital (nice interior and facilites-just wasn't fortunate enough to join their lab team, sgh!) with fairly reasonable price (for most western expats that is!).

Only Love & Respect of Others Make us Human. ================================== Thanks all for your feedback. AXA and Al-Koot is the same. But what I am not clear about is Primary Network. Can someone explain? Do I need to go to another hospital before I go to Al-Ahli. Al-Ahli is very close to our house and I was thinking of find a good GP (primary care giver) in Al Ahli for my family.

If you just want to visit a general practitioner then you could try Dr Pamela at Al Ahli.  She is Scottish and is very approachable and knows her stuff.  I took my daughter to her as she had a serious urine infection, the treatment she received was second to none and she was referred to a great Urologist at Al Ahli as well.  You dont need a referral to see Dr pamela just phone Al Ahli hospital and go through to the appointments section (sometimes it diverts to voicemail but go back to the Operator and they will transfer you direct to the appointments desk)  Hope this helps.   know from experience what a nightmare it can be finding a really good GP out here.	1

Mandoop can guide your husband specially if your husband cant speak arabic. But still people in immigrations are all professional. They need some explaination more from your husband rather than from your mandoop. This does not mean you can get it if you go there. Sometimes you have to come not only once, twice but sometimes more than 3 times. So let your husband prepare all the papers and go by himself. Speak to higher authority and get the document signed. Hope ou can get it!	1

Then when he is coming, be sure to have an affidavit of support attested here,(saying that you will be supporting your husband althroughout his stay in Qatar) since it will be asked in the Philippine immigration...and of course, he should be very familiar with your address and work here since...again....it will be asked in the Philippine immig. Good Luck!!! I know the feeling...that's why I am relieved that my husband is now here with me...soon inshallah I can get my kids :)	1

Hi all, First thanks a lot for this wonderful forum. My question is about family. I've been offered a post with QP in Doha and will join in May. I'm married with 2 kids (4 and 1). We're weighing the pros and cons of mobilizing them with me at first, or after a couple of months. What do you think guys? BTW the employer is providing the housing and all. Thx	If everything's taken care of...I'd suggest you come here first and settle in nicely, find out about admissions and schools for your kids and then bring them along. Its useless yanking them from school where ever they are just to know that u might have to wait till next semester to get admissions or something.	1

And you have to get your RP sorted out before you can bring your family anyway, and then your family visa and who knows how long that will take. So you are going to be busy when you first come over anyway.	1

Once your family joins you, you will be entitled for all the allowance of a 'Family status' person and also wil be provided a house/villa by the company.	1

Can Anyone help me in this??? I could not complete my education ... i l be 25 tis september... is their any way to get a batchelors degree from qatar while working???	this is a real problem, i believe. as far as I know, no accrediated university/college offers provides a 100% distant learning bachelors degree programme. They'd require you to study FULL-TIME or Atleast spend 2 years at the college/university. However you could get executive certificate, diploma programs etc. http://www.u21global.edu.sg/Education/About/Offices#ua but that'd be overly expensive, and might not be as useful for you, as for any graduate person. If you can afford to stay away from work for 2 years atleast go back to your home country to get a bachelors, or try QU/CNAQ Qatar or Dubai universities if you can afford.

I dont have anyone here. I do everything for my son, breakfast, lunch, and even wash him before I leave home. She feed him the breakfast and lunch, and changed him probably 2 times while I am away. He sleeps out of 6 hours at home 2-3 hours, so literally she stays with him awake around 3-4 hours which are great. He always sounds happy when I call to check on him. My husband also bombards her with calls asking her about our son. Our son makes noises and sings when I talk toher on the phone and even when I get home he is singing. I know them he is ok and happy. I am the one who baths him and take care of HIM when I reach home. The maid doesnt touch or seem him again until the next morning!!!	0

Crisis is around, haven’t noticed? even on term deposit account they offer up to 4.5% in offshore banks... when you find any higher interest, pls let me know. ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”.

I had to leave Qatar suddenly in 2007, im trying to come back to work in the country but since I left so suddenly I didnt pay off my debts with a bank.  Can they stop me coming back in?  What should I do?  I have no problems paying them off, I just need to get in contact with them.  Can they issue an arrest warrant for me?  How can I find out if they already have? Any info would be greatly appreciated	just pay ur debts. yup, u might have problems getting in, if u didn't. it depends on the amount as well.     If you're looking for a problem, you're probably gonna find one.	1

Any info would be greatly appreciated	If you are so willing to pay the debts, why didn't you just go to the bank and do it before you left?  It doesn't take that long to visit a bank and pay a bill - 3 hours tops.  I would say you are now black listed with the CID and you won't get a visa to return.  If you come you may get arrested at immigration.	1

If you borrow money then you have to pay it back you are responsible for your debts and the way you handle them.	1

Any info would be greatly appreciated	SC...ok.... do u have online banking with them? how long is it since u have left? what was ur outstanding then? u need to take under consideration, that u will have to pay the interest and maybe some fees as well. call that bank if u cannot check the outstanding online. u will be blacklisted from the QCB for sure anyway. about the CID-might be, too. if the amount was big, u may be in trouble once getting here. i don't think they'd put u into jail in here for that though. good luck.

Any info would be greatly appreciated	It is very serious to leave the country and not pay debts, banks in general don't like this even if there is an insurance to cover bad debts. If we have debts, we are responsible to act accordingly to pay the debts, otherwise anyone can come to Qatar, borrow money, and then disappear - hmmm I don't think so -  this is a capital offence. His best bet is to check with the bank to see if they have done anything i.e. informed the police or CID otherwise there is a high risk that he will be arrested upon arrival at Doha.	1

Any info would be greatly appreciated	If the bank has already informed the authorities and you are on the black list, it is a problem... unless you sort out with the bank and they clear your name . Clearing the name again can be a problem since the offence is a state offence and not a matter of the bank only.. If they have not informed the bank... talking and sorting things out may help.... All depends on the amount... Normally bank may not care about small amounts, unless big enough to cover the cost of following it up... Big amounts sometimes have had interpol involved as well... ...You can't mean what you say unless you can say what you mean...	1

Is this right? Is it all what they need or more paperwork is required? Should the embassy letters – in case required – by ratified by the Qatar MOFA? Any answers would be appreciated.	yes you need no objections letters from both the embassies.	1

Hi roadrunner200, I am also in the process of transferring my residence permit to my new passport. I also got a new nationality. My husband (my sponsor) went to the Immigration in Al Gharraga and was told to provide NOC from the previous nationality. They said no need the NOC from the embassy of the new passport. So I went to my former embassy and got the NOC. As far as I know, you will be needing the NOC together with the filled-up form (change of nationality) and copies of the old and new passports. We submitted all the paper works last week and told to come back in 2 weeks. You will be given a receipt that they have received the documents. By the way, the form must be filled-up and signed by your sponsor. Regards	1

I'm planning of bringing a srilankan maid. She is asking for 30000 srilankan rupees as insurance, but I have no idea what kind of insurance this is? Am I supposed to pay this amount? Please help...	Hi, We were about to hire a Sri Lankan maid and noone asked us for an insurance. As our maid let us down the very last minute, do you know anyone in Sri Lanka who would like to work for an European family with a baby? We already have got a visa approval. Please, it is very urgent as I want to train her before I get back to work. Why don't you send her a a contract letter and the visa document, so she's on the safe side. So do you. She needs to sign one copy and send it back to you. Hope we could help each other	1
I'm planning of bringing a srilankan maid. She is asking for 30000 srilankan rupees as insurance, but I have no idea what kind of insurance this is? Am I supposed to pay this amount? Please help...	mrs pumpkin I'm in the same boat as you are. I also need a maid to take care of my son. After getting the visa and approval from the srilankan embassy, she sends me an sms that i need to send the money for the insurance. I dont know if it is srilankan govt policy or not, but if I have already got the approval from the embassy, I'm assuming it is insurance to protect her in case she gets into any trouble abroad. All said and done I guess she should be the one paying for her insurance, not me but I need help from someone who knows how this kind of stuff works	0
I'm planning of bringing a srilankan maid. She is asking for 30000 srilankan rupees as insurance, but I have no idea what kind of insurance this is? Am I supposed to pay this amount? Please help...	Hi, This is an insurance policy which the employee has to take for herself and which is a mandatory requirement from the Foreign Employment Bureau of Sri Lanka. The insurance premium is based on the Salary as per the employment contract. This amount has to be paid by the employee before he/she leaves the country.	1
I'm planning of bringing a srilankan maid. She is asking for 30000 srilankan rupees as insurance, but I have no idea what kind of insurance this is? Am I supposed to pay this amount? Please help...	I will explain the insurence produre 1st. There is a government regulation that all workers irrespective of their job catogory have to pay a fee to the government something like RS. 11,000 for 2 years which includes insurence cover for any eventuallity (House maids fee should be cheeper. you can chek that with sri lankan embassy here. if you have a problem getting info from the embassy PM me. Charge de Affairs is a personal friend of mine). Nodody will be allowed leave Sri Lanka without the paid stamp in their passport. They will be stopped at the airport by the officials if they don't have that stamp. This amount shall be paid by the employee in most cases but it is up to you to negotiate that with your maid. Why don't you send her a a contract letter and the visa document, so she's on the safe side. So do you. She needs to sign one copy and send it back to you. yes you need to send the original of the contract attested by sri lanka embassy in qatar for her to obtain this stamp from the immigration department back in sri lanka. no stamp from the qatar embassy here on the contract means she will not be able to secure the immigration stamp in Sri Lanka. You may contact me through PM if you need more info.	1

I'm planning of bringing a srilankan maid. She is asking for 30000 srilankan rupees as insurance, but I have no idea what kind of insurance this is? Am I supposed to pay this amount? Please help...	The SL Bureau of foreign employment provides insurance when the candidate registers and pay a nominal fee. You could ask the reason for another insurance? Many who come may not be fully aware so you could tell them this. Agree your terms so that both of you are not dissappointed when you see a gap within the expectations once she's under your roof. This happens the most.	1

However, I must warn you, that handrearing such tiny kitten can be harrowing and success is only 20 - 40%. Meaning, no matter how well you take care of it, death is always a nearby factor. Please don't let it upset you or feel like you've done something wrong if this happens. Kittens, unlike puppies are way more sensitive and require mom's care and attention more than puppies do. Also, there is a reason that the mom left this kitten behind - she probably felt it wasn't going to survive - survival of the fittest and all that.... 1) Don't feed cows milk - You will find Baby Kat milk at the vets - they will also have kit for you to feed the kitten with. 2) Do keep the kitten as warm as possible - they cannot regulate their own body temperature - so finding a hot water bottle( a difficult task in Doha, I have tried) or a heating pad will work as an external source of heat - never putting the kitten directly on these items as they can scold, or electricute in the case of the heating pad. 3) Do make sure to keep the kittens bowels stimulated with warm damp cotton wool - this is done after the 6 feeds at 3 hourly intervals. You rub the cotton wool over the kitten's private areas in the same manner the mom would lick the kitten to do the same. Please do read the site info I have given you, and try to find anything else useful on the internet pertaining to hand rearing kittens.	1

I cannot tell you how important it is to keep the kitten warm - use a small box, or one that will fit the hot water bottle or the heating pad, alone with a towel to cover those items - you can use a themometer and adjust the heat as described in the article I have given you. Do put a fluffy toy in with the kitten... it won't feel so alone. Don't get a fright to, if the kitten starts to deficate on its own inside its bed, this will happen too, but don't forget to stimulate it too. A kitten should urinate often, but in my experience, they only deficate 1 time a day, 2 times at the most in the first 1/2 weeks... there after it becomes more frequent.	1

If QL Admin is reading this post, with All Due Respect Sir/Madam, you could have at least sent me PM saying about my mistake. i've been out in QL for a long time now and just posting "Found Lost Persian Cat" as a sign of care for an animal and for the person who own this cat. I hope you understand.	1
about "Found Lost Persian Cut". Delete with no reason at all? If i had a mistake posting on a wrong window, you should have at least told me where to put it.	Yes I concur with you about the feedback, but my guess is, that could be the reason for its deletion, because it says, "ENGLISH" only!!! :-(	1

UAE amnesty to illegal workersPublished: Tuesday, 5 June, 2007, 02:02 AM Doha Time DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates has launched a three-month amnesty to allow illegal workers to regularise their situation or leave without facing penalty, the local press reported yesterday. – AFP ....Just wondering, are there any similar illegal immigrants in Qatar ??	there are. Anyone with an expired RP is illegal. There are also those who arrive on visit visas and don't leave together with those who enter illegaly.	1

Do you know what are the penalties imposed on those who overstay ? Are there any cases of those who cross the border or arrive by sea without travelling documents ? How about those who employ the illegals ? What does the Law say ?	0

I'm no legal expert but the penalties for overstaying your visa will be heavy monetarily I assume. There have in the past been instances of people arriving without documents. The penalties for employing someone without the correct paperwork will be heavy. There have been amnesties in the past in Qatar. Recent cases in Abu Dhabi have also resulted in 2 months prison and a fine for sheltering such illegals.	1

If someone is caught working in a company not his/her sponsor w/ the excemption of a female on husband/father sponsor, He/She will be asked to pay a penalty of QR4,500 and possible deportation.

How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.	1
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Thank you Shapil for the nice Info. Do I need to do finger printing again since I did it last year when I first came her in Doha? By the way I am on a family visa sponsor by my husband. Was accepted for a job at a gov't facility and they told me to wait for there call in Gods will it will all be fine after 2 weeks but still did'nt recieve any call from them. Do you have any idea what procedure will go through since they get all the copy of my identification cards?	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Tepgam your situation is slightly complicated than mine...hopefully somebody else can respond to your queries as i am not sure myself.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67, if you have an RP here, to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days, sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa), you cannot work, and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.	1
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	QatariSon...my first response was based upon the OP which did not mention anything about the family visa and my second response after i was enlightened. Kindly revisit. Jumping the Gun is not professionalism.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	i am not sOn, I am sUn. thank you. she didn't mention family visa, but she stated clearly "Work Permit", which needed only while you are on Family visa. What you were talking about is getting a residence permit while you are on Work Visa. completely two different visas and situations.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Qatarisun, if we don't blame others wouldn't it be nice ? No one was born professional, i couldn't say a single word, or take a single step, when i was born, and i think same for everybody, so dealing others according to their capacities would be positive one. Wonderful Qoute, in your signature "What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us."	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	I did not know that the work permit is only required if you are on family visa. Enlightenment never stops. Thanks sUn. You are truly a professional.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	you are welcome, shapil, it is never late to learn. again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT, since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP, I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working). But now she has chosen to work. And all she needs now is a PERMISSION to WORK (Work Permit). I hope this time you see the difference. If not, just drop it..	1
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	bluesoul, it is not about capacity. shapil's "capacity" in Business Management Software Solutions Applications is definitely much higher than my "capacity" at the same field. I am talking about giving useless advices to people who needs to get correct solution to their problems, and not to be misled. I would never suggest on any SAP solutions, I will wait till shapil - as a professional - will do it. Because my suggestion in SAP field will sound as silly as his suggestion in the field of HR and Immigration laws.	0

Minoush, make sure you have a spare tire and then if you get a flat just pull over and either look helpless or change to the spare yourself. Then drive to one of the many garages and they will patch your flat in no time for 15 QAR. Also, for a breakdown, see if your auto dealer/service center has roadside service. Mine, Al Fardan, does. But once when I came to a dead stop (for no apparent reason) at one of the traffic lights on Al Sadd Rd (I forget the cross street now) it took the guy 2 hours to find me. Mandi	1

If the hoemorroids is already persisting, cream will not work anymore. He should avoid prolonged standing and pressure like carrying heavy things, to avoid bleeding. It will be better for him to see any surgeon for that matter. If it is already big and can't be pushed inside anymore then he should undergo laser surgery.	1

Any comparable  swimming pool around?Any advice? Thanks 4 advance	 I think the mall swimming pool is unhygienically maintained because of the huge number of people who use it . Please check the cleanliness of the pool before you jump in. There is a good clean pool for women, near the Mid mac roundabout. There is one at the Indian club on the way to Wakra. All come in the ranges of less than QR500 per month. Aunt Polly	1

Plus there looks to be a family fodd store just down the road. I must say, some of the houses around look quite big. The one that i am talking about has 3 beds 2 baths plus another toilet. I also noticed quite a few that had large walls are a gate around them them. One set had a few villas in and a big gate to go into. Not sure yet which is the one for rent.	1

Where does one find good idili ,dosa south indian cuisine ?	u can hav good idlies n dosa in,garden resuarant,shalimar near crazy signal,flavours near baby shop,and a new veg resuatrant has opned"Barath Bavan"near crazy signal dont know the exact location,if anyones plz post it	1
Where does one find good idili ,dosa south indian cuisine ?	I've been to Bonanza, but only in the mornings, and yeh, they are much better than what you'd get at Garden or Prestige... Infact, I've not come across any good UDIPI joint here that serves yummie dosa's etc... So hun... holla me when you get to know of anything... :-D	1
Where does one find good idili ,dosa south indian cuisine ?	will do ,once i find something .Where is this bonanza?Any landmark for it ? NO UDIPI in Doha thats sad .lets get one here ;) Thanks everybody for info .Pls keep updating it with new eating joints .I guess we can Spare the 5 stars and try others	0
Where does one find good idili ,dosa south indian cuisine ?	Well I dunno what places do you know in Qatar? It's in Bin Mahmoud area, which is bang opposite to the "Center" shopping or just besides the Jaidah Flyover. Will take you for a treat on friday/saturday morning. ----------------------------------------- Buick's new car is called 71.

Where does one find good idili ,dosa south indian cuisine ?	jaidah flyover is only name i cld relate to .....around ramada ? pls Suggest some more joints ....like good ones any cuisines wow cool treat :)	0
Where does one find good idili ,dosa south indian cuisine ?	Since you understand Jaidah flyover, this is the direction to Bonanza (the best place for quality taste but down market for "treat"). Leave the Jaidah flyover while driving from Ramada and take a U-turn below the flyover. Then turn first right inside-that area is bin Mehmoud. Cross first red light straight and 5 shops before the next signal on the right is Bonanza. Today a new Vegetarian restaurant called Vasant Bhawan is opened on the Crazy signal in Aljazeera Appartments building. This could be worth a try. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer	1

Hello.. Does anyone here know where i can fish and hook some big gamers fish..? So that my friends & I can jigg & troll during the weekends.

Hello could anyone here help me on average breakfast,lunch and dinner cost for 1 person in duha? Thanks Life is FUN!	if you are too busy to cook, join a food mess. there is one at the Sri Lankan restaurant - Majestic for about QR300 per month which includes lunch & dinner. for breakfast, there is another Sri Lankan restaurant - Salamath ( go down the road where Anana's is located) you have to pay a monthly fee of Qr. 250 - which works more like a deposit. you can eat against the paid Qr 250. they have a separate card for each customer who joins this programme of them & at the end of every month they evaluate your total budget against the paid QR250. if you have eaten for more than the paid QR250, you have to re-pay them the balance or if you have eaten less than QR250, they will carry on the balance to the following month. how ever in both scenarios, you are also entitled for a 10% discount of what you have eaten for that particular month. also you can have all 3 meals there. how ever, it is better to contact them first :) hope this info was useful :)	1

Hello could anyone here help me on average breakfast,lunch and dinner cost for 1 person in duha? Thanks Life is FUN!	Majestic is a Sri Lankan resto. The cuisine is certainly Asian and quite spicy! But if you are into the hot and yummy then nothing quite beats it. SL food is cheap but the quality and portions are quite good. Indian food is pretty cheap too as is Arabic food. Once you get here do a search and I'm sure you'll find something to match your taste buds,Insha Allah. Bon appetit!	0

Hey there Christmas is coming and it would be great to get a REAL christmas tree. Anyone know if any of the many supermarkets bring them in? Would like to know in case I have to pre-order.	If you find one let me know.	0
Hey there Christmas is coming and it would be great to get a REAL christmas tree. Anyone know if any of the many supermarkets bring them in? Would like to know in case I have to pre-order.	I was looking at importing a fiber optic Christmas tree from the UK. But they are so heavy 3kg+ the shipping would sting too much. Real ones make too much mess.	0

Hey there Christmas is coming and it would be great to get a REAL christmas tree. Anyone know if any of the many supermarkets bring them in? Would like to know in case I have to pre-order.	Not sure why there is such confusion this late in November. Home Center has the fiber optic trees (half-size) in their backroom. MegaMart near Ramada has MANY varieties of trees. Dasman still hasn't received theirs. And Carrefour can't decide whether or not to keep stocked or sell out and let the emptiness speak for itself. There are other small sales places around Doha (similar to MegaMart's multi-mini-shop method) that have some. Just don't hold your breath on a REAL wood tree. :^P	1

Hey there Christmas is coming and it would be great to get a REAL christmas tree. Anyone know if any of the many supermarkets bring them in? Would like to know in case I have to pre-order.	I have had both, and the mess of the real wooden tree is worth the scent and flavor of being poked by real pine needles and enjoying the natural variety. But in Qatar, it is not worth the huge expense of getting a dried out, underbred, withered and scrawny wooden tree. Btw, Home Center in the City Centre Mall now has x3 varieties of trees (including full size), as well as many decorations. Note: Still cannot find a decent star or similar decoration for the top of my tree. Family Food carries cheap plastic types, though they DO sell the Santa caps (in Al Nasser), Mega Mart has an option though not a star.	0

Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	It's better and healthier to lose weight the natural way--excercise! Herbal medicines are not good for your health. Check the internet for side effects of taking such kinds of medicines.	1
Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	I've been using this great products and lost great weight in healthy way by eating properly and execising, they are totally natural and healthy, and the company existcs 28 years now. I just want to know if there is somebody in Qatar who can get them for me...I really thrust them and love them so I want to use them...their shakes are so tastey and delicious one could say fast food for smart people	1
Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	where do we get this herbal life????	0
Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	Just eat healthy and exercise. Companies like this have existed for so long because there is no end of gullible people in the world, looking for a quick-fix solution.	1

Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	Mr_rob I don't think so!!! i lost 17 kilos with their produsct and no body can say it doesn't work!!!!!!!! It worked for me perfectly and not just for me but my husband lost 20 kilos!!!!!!!!!! Of course if you want perfect body you need to exercise!!!! There in no magic pill that you take and you are fit instantly, BUT the products are unbelivable and i know there are 100ts of milion people using them and having great results!!!! i know HERBALIFE has branches inmore than 60 countries around the world, i was wondering if somebody knows if i could get some products i Qatar!!!!!! Does somebody knows about some distributor in Qatar?????????	1
Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	would these products happen to come with a limited-calorie diet plan as well, by any chance? I'm guessing you probably weren't on the Pizza Hut diet plan when you were taking them? The only reason you lost weight is because your calories were significantly reduced, not because of some silly little herbal pill. Regardless, GNC over here (there's one in city centre mall) sell a load of pointless herbal tat for the gullible, with such claims as "Guaranteed to work!!!!! (when taken in conjunction with a 500 calorie diet". 	0
Does anybody know is there someone who can recomend HERBALIFE products?	No, I eat shake for breakfast with cereals and juice or milk, befor shake i took my fibres and herbs - for digestion, multivitamins and minerals!!! Than a small meal around 11am (cheese or fruit, almonds...protein bar...) and drink water because fibres needs water so your digestion would work!!!!! before my traditional lunch (Croats like to eat meat and potatos, salade, soup, dessert!!!) I took my herbs and vitamins, drink water... Around 4pm I took more fruit, almonds...protein bar..., water... And for dinner I eat my shake meal in summer strawberry flavour with fresh strawberries, ice and juice all blended in the most delicious shake you ever tried!!!! So I wasn't hungry, din't have 500 calories diet - actually I had 2000 calories diet!!!!!!!! That is important!!! And drink a lots of water (because you need it for all vital functions - 70-80% of our body is made of water :)) ), i didn't drink cola or any gas drinks - personally I don't like them and they give you cellulite :))) I don't know about other companies and their products - what they do to your body, BUT I am fully convinced in results with HERBALIFE products... Maybe if you try their shakes you would agree with me :) Ther is one IMPORTANT THING - if you want better and unbelivable result you need to exercise at least 30 minutes EVERY day - but fast walking is also an execise so that's not so hard, am i right?	1

It is easier to loose weight together or with a goal. My next step is 8kg until the 02.04. (wedding dress fitting) I start yesterday with fasten, only for one week. Let's see our body transformation.	The only way to lose weight and maintain it is by changing your eating/training/sleeping lifestyle for ever. IF not, you will always gain more weight than what you lost and this is why people who diet a lot tend to get fatter as they age. It is not a temporary thing. It is a lifestyle change. So, you need to not deprive yourself completely for everything you like at once. msg me if you need any help. I know a lot about this topic and I have helped many others get to their goals.	1

hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	I haven't tried any pill and I would suggest you stay away from them, they either don't work or compromise your health. I lost all my pregnancy weight by keeping active, going for long walks and doing excersise at home (particularly dancing to MTV!). I do not eat a lot because never had a big appetite and always get stomach pains if I over eat, but I eat pretty much what I want, just small quantities. So that's my secret: Excersise and eat everything in small portions. Now, I want to get fat. Has anyone any secrets for putting on weitht?	1
hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	how long walks? other than dancing to mtv, any specific workout u used to do at home. my babies dont let me exercise at home properly.i am trying to lose 5kgs and its that adamant pregnancy weight.i managed to do it when my son was one, but now with 2 to handle, i am finding it difficult, although i am kept busy whole day.my diet has gone for a toss bcos, with the kids by the time its lunch its past 3 in the afternoon and i tend to skip it, now i am not hungry during lunch. you said u want to get fat, are u skinny?	0
hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	No works outs for me...find them really boring :(. I used to go to the Corniche everyday and walk fast for two hours. I have started doing it again as it gets cooler, not so much because I want to lose weight but because it makes me feel wonderful. Wow, with two little ones no wonder you don't find the times to look after your diet. Maybe try not to skip meals, but instead doing big meals eat little things often just to speed up your metabolism? Yup, I'm skinny now, I'm happiest with my body when I'm between 50 and 55 kg. I think curvier women and much sexier than skinnier ones so don't stress too much about losing weight as long as you are healthy and feel good about yourself.	1
hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	i do feel good about myself, whatever i do is to boost my self image for myself a bit more and feel more happier.i had managed to lose the weight the first time round, but this time its taking a bit longer so at times feel dejected. i was thinking of jumpstarting the loss by trying actrim but cant do it since i am still feeding my baby. wow 2 hours is a good time to walk, i shud do that provided my husband agress to sit with the babies, thats the problem, not enough time. i am disciplined with home workouts, quite obsessive infact,i have my own workout figured out, but no consistency cos i do it religiously for 3 weeks, then my kids are sick for a week during which they dont leave my side and by the end of 10days they have given the infection to me. so 2 weeks is lost recuperating and i need to start all over again. this has been going on for the past 4months, and i have managed only 3kg. i too dont exercise for the figure factor, but for health as i need to, have a predisposition to diabetes and hypertension, saw both of it during my pregnancy, so its already a lifestyle change for me. i should try 2 hour walk at corniche, i love walking there no matter what weather, have u tried walking briskly during winters, its crazy, but feels good at the end of it. i used to walk for 50mins when i cud take that time out. do u have kids?	1
hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	mine is almost 14 months old. Last winter it was easy to go for brisk walks...you know, sit her on her stroller and just push her and run up and down the corniche...she would be asleep within ten minutes. But now she insists in getting out of the pushchair and walking as well so is a little bit more difficult!. Maybe the weith you put on during the second pregnancy takes a little bit longer to come off. Maybe you are holding onto some fat while you are still breastfeeding and it will come off once you wean your baby, I heard that happens often. Anyways 3 kg in four months sounds fine,pregnancy weight always take longer to get rid of, just keep your diet and work outs and go for walks whenever you can and I'm sure you will slim down :)	1

hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	Its a simple equation. What you eat - energy you consume = net fat gain/loss. You either eat less or use up more energy. There is no magic potion, pill or diet. You have to make a lifestyle change. Small changes in lifestyle (substituting skimmed for full fat milk, avoiding fried food etc etc) will mean a gradual weight loss but its more likely to become permenant. Other helpful hints include increasing muscle mass to increase metabolism and eating most of your calories early on in the day. No night binging.	1

hi all, anyone lost serious weight in the recent past, if you have then please give an insight to your secret.how did u manage it? what did u do? while on weight loss subject do herbalife, slimfast, Actrim work for weight loss, anyone tried it before. stay healthy	I'm not expert but I reckon at this age her nutricionial requirements should be covered during the day, she shouldn't need feeding at all during the nighttime...maybe she is just thirsty? Try giving her water everytime she wakes up. Otherwise, horrible as it sounds, maybe you can just let her cry it out. 1 year babies know how to use crying not to only to communicate basic needs but just to get some attention. Perhaps if you ignore it for a couple of nights, she will learn that crying at night will not get her what she wants (your attention) and realise that nights are for sleeping. hope it helps	1

What is the effective way to lose weight? I'm not obese but I want to lose weight. Some of my friends told me not to eat rice,bread and pasta. Is this right?	Hi Buttercuple, do away with fastfood (chips, deep fried chicken) as first they are unhealthy. I don't think there's anything wrong with rice, pasta or bread as long as you eat them in moderation. Tayo kasing mga pinoy, rice in the am, lunch and pm :), pero cguro kapag isang cup lang per serving wala nang second serving ok pa din un. Eating a balanced diet and exercise (aerobic exercise at least 30 mins a day) is the best. If this doesn't work, meron akong produkto which is a slimming program na introduce sayo...just pm me ok.	1

What is the effective way to lose weight? I'm not obese but I want to lose weight. Some of my friends told me not to eat rice,bread and pasta. Is this right?	There is no "One diet for all"....we all have different body types, metabolisms, activity levels, etc... Cutting out carbs is one way to reduce your caloric intake (like the atkins diet)....but unless its a permanent change (ie lifestyle change and not just a diet for a certain period), the weight tends to return. Generally speaking (unless there are medical reasons mostly to do with metabolism), a person's weight is a function of how many calories they itake, and how many they work off (by exercising)....and exercising doesn't JUST mean the gym.... The best Advice I can give you is not to follow a pre printed diet, but go to a nutritionist who can tailor a diet for your specific body type and needs...at least that's what I would do in Canada....I don't even know if there are certified nutritionists in Qatar. Hope that helps...and whatever you decide, good luck. Stay safe. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore, is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?	1
What is the effective way to lose weight? I'm not obese but I want to lose weight. Some of my friends told me not to eat rice,bread and pasta. Is this right?	Avoiding Rice , bread , pasta is a low carb diet, if you avoid carbohydrates and sugar you will see the difference in 2 weeks. You can eat more proteins ....like lean meat, sprouts and pulses. I was on a fruit and veggie diet. I am lighter by 5 kgs in one week…it really works!	1

Is this right?	everyone is differant, but to lose weight it has to be a lifstyle change as once you go of the diet you can actually put more weight back on eat sesable and exersise. A doctor once told me try to avoid worring about actually how much you weigh and go for apperance. following a low carb diet works you mainly limit the intake of what are known to be BAD carbs things like to much rice,pasta, bread dont forget there are good carbs and you need these when you exersice to help develop mussle i suggest eating a bannana before exersiceing as this gives you energy as well as helps with the fat burning procces. when switching from a poor diet to a more structured one try taking a good multi vitamin just to help kick start everything again. Also try just changing eating habits make sure you eat a good breakfast and switch your main meal to the middle of the day as thats when we require the most energy also try not to eat more than 2-3 hours before bed.	1

Honda cars are generally built in Japan to very high standards and as far as I know Domasco offers good and efficient service.  The Camry is built in Australia to nowhere near the same level or quality, and servicing a Toyota here seems to be a laborious and time consuming exercise. It's always a matter of personal opinion, but on balance I'd go for the Honda any day. 	1

Please advise me...!! I gonna buy Renault Clio 2006. What is maintenance cost? spare parts are available easily? how is petrol/fuel consumption ? please give me you suggestion according to the above points.	What is maintenance cost?>>>Depends on the part to be replaced. But yes a little over than the japanese counterpart but not everything in it. spare parts are available easily?>>>Yes! Unless it's a rare Renault. how is petrol/fuel consumption? A Clio has 16 valves which would mean it's fuel efficient, but hey, you're in the mideast where water is more expensive than petrol!

hello everyone. i'm sick and tired of using the roads and wait in traffic jams so i deided to buy a used 4x4 to discover some new places that only a 4x4 can take u there. the two best are landcruiser and nissan patrol but witch is better in terms of quality and service? please if u r an owner of one of these two cars i need your advice.	Id say the New Landcruiser.. The ride qulaity is unbeliveable u just dont feel a thing on / off road.. its worth the price..   Plusresale value is good too compared to the patrol..

Never buy 2nd hand 4x4 ...atleast here in the Gulf, especially the Landcruisers & Patrols. The Gear, the Axle & the Engine are abused to the maximum....through all the various stunts that one might otherwise see in a circus. If you are seeking a  brand new low cost option a Mahindra Scorpio QR 55,000 or Honda CRV QR 85,000 is quite good. In fact the Scorpio ar QR 55,000 is  cost as less as a Toyota Corolla at the same time giving you a 4x4 option  and a lot  other small but important options(like rear A/C  vents which is missing in CRV), rear 12V outlet, 8seater capacity etc. 	1

Landcruiser and Patrol are top of the line and hard to choose from if its only going to be one.. pros and cons can go on and on for each one, but from where i stand, - the new land cruisers have a "smaller" engine, though they say it give the same "power" - patrol just might be coming up with a new design soon cuz its been a while but my biggest con for the landcruiser WHO DOESNT HAVE ONE IN DOHA?? it'll always be JUST another landy.. humph..	1

Are there mental health professionals in Qatar that provide on going therapy or is this strictly a Western tradition? Certainly marriage conflict, depression, and anxiety occur within the expat population.	No. Most Qatari people don't get counseling/therapy. People here think that if you see a therapist, then you must be crazy. This is the reason why most people I know here are depressed.	0

If so how was your experience??? To be honest I am little freaked out about having this done here, so I ma really looking forward to hearing advice and experience of other parents.

A very good ENT doctor is Dr Osama Bukri (am not too sure about the spelling of last name) He is a private ENT specialist. No nonsens guy and will advise you what to do. His clinic is just next to Midmac on the side where they are braking up the road. So if you are at Midmac, go towards the Amiri road that is broken up, do the U turn and come back to Midmac. His building is the last one on your right. No appointment needed. He is the best. Go to him and ask him. Aisha-Taweela	0

Aisha - do you or someone you know have a personal experience with him??? I for sure will get atleast a consultation with him. Amoud - He was born with big tonsils but his pediatrician had said to leave it alone, but about a 2yr back he was diagnosed with ragweed allergy, whihc back in canada would start around spring and last till fall, and soon after that he started to snore at night, so he was sent to ENT who said its his Adenoids that are large and while they are removing that they will also remove the tonsils, but after moving to Doha last summeer he quit snoring and came back in winter, so i personally think its allregy of somesort that triggers the adenoids to become large, so I am hoping to consult few good ENT and pediatrician to get thier opinion and go from there on.	0

Hey bstmom, fellow canuk ;) I had the same issue with allergies and tonsils but not adenoids. I dont have a lot of faith in Drs. here, you get some great ones at times but I am not sure about them when it comes to cutting my kids. I waited to get some stuff done when I went back to Canada for vacation. Even for myself, I contacted my Dr. by email and as he knew my history etc and what I wanted done I scheduled the procedure before I came (although I ended up paying but at least you know you are in good hands). ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	0

Some people may think its good, some says it's bad and/or both... I find it cute as long as it's made out of fun and not make a career out of it. Coz some parents do Do you think it helps children gain confidence or makes them lose confidence if they lose the pageant? What do you think of child beauty pageants?	Well, yeah. Dressing little girls like supermodels is cute and it helps them gain confidence. However, i think there's some sort of psychological effect with the kids. Just like what I've seen in Dr. Phil. It makes little girls obsessed with make-ups, clothes, shoes, bags and the list goes on. And the worst effect is the kids feels like they should always look skinny. And its really bad for their health. cheers, paul	1

They shouldn't even allow such kind of competitions. It is a way of exploiting children for financial gains by the parents. How can you get confidence by attending such events, where you will be judged by your external appearance? Confidence is something to do with the way you think, not the way you look. Shame to the parents who are putting their kids through such competitions.	1

I think any kind of competitions in which children are judged on appearance are wrong! This way they will only learn to be superficial and judge other people on looks instead of character.	1

Buddy, go through your contract, signed and agreed between you and your employer. Read thoroughly the clauses especially the "Termination of Contract". In normal course, either party can terminate the contract with 1 to 7days notice subject to the terms and conditions specified on the contract. If you terminate the contract within the probation period, you will have to pay a lump sum amount to the employer towards the cost of visa, medical, and other expenses if any. Also you will have to buy the ticket from your pocket. However the employer has no right to hold u back but can ban you for 2 years without providing an NOC. So think twice... gud luck...	1

Any good advice out there so i can go home?	regarding probationary period and contract termination. Usually, there are provisions for terminating contract by either party. The most important thing here is sincerity, and I hope the family problem you are mentioning is real. I read some of your past comments on some threads and I'm really having a second thought about your real intention. Actually, it should have been a different story if you had not submitted a resignation letter but since you have already, my advice is, if you are still within the probationary period, submit a letter of termination for your contract or submit an irrevocable resignation stating your reasons. Then study the Qatar Labor Law as to what are the consequences of such actions. But do not abscond but wait 'til they accept your letter. MAke sure you have a receipt copy of your letter bearing the date it was pass and received by the company!	1

Any good advice out there so i can go home?	its better for you to tell to your boss honestly what is happening, and I believe he will understand your situation. Saeedkan is correct, your boss finds you suitable for your job, that is why he is having a hard time, or even already decided to keep you within the company. I can suggest, apply for an EMERGENCY LEAVE, that way at least, you can assure your boss that you are coming back. Once in the Philippines, way all your options and decide if you are coming back or not, but still THE BEST WAY IS TO COME BACK, of course, for you and for your family's good. Definitely, your boss wants to keep you, so the best way is to assure him your coming back. In that way he will have peace and no worries.	1

My daughter has gone there for 2 years now. I like it a lot. You'll have to drive but it's pretty much a straight shot from the QF area. You basically have to drive everywhere here. Stafish Lane Kids - 580 5830, 580 5103 - near Landmark Mall	1

Thanks for your help.	Hi, Thanks everyone for the prompt response. I have twins (boy and girl) that will be about 10 months when I arrive. I was hoping Qatar Academy but they're too young for that. By the way, how much are these nurseries? Any discounts for more than one child?	0

Thanks for your help.	Just threw the price list away but we pay 1700 QR for 5 days a week for a 3 yr old. Starfish is a great place. Not a lot of turnover as far as I can tell, great play area, great teachers and asst. teachers, owners who give back to charity... I believe they do discount.	1

Thanks for your help.	Do "Creative Child" and "Starfish" have websites? I did a search on google but couldn't find any. I was also wondering if you've ever considered a nanny instead of the nursery. What made you choose the latter? Thanks again for all your help.	0

I'm moving to Qatar in early 2008 from Canada. Can someone advise me of some good nurseries in and around the Qatar Foundation? Names/contact info would be good. Are any of them walking distance? Thanks for your help.	rsher - Was looking in the latest Marhaba (welcome) book and saw that both Starfish and Creative Child take kids beginning at age 1 but if you get here at 10 months it might take 2 months or so on a waiting list anyway. Also, saw Mary Poppins Nursery. Haven't heard anything about this one except one mom was unimpressed when she saw a t.v. in one of the rooms. It's a little bit further down the road from Starfish. Emails - starfishkids@hotmail.com creativechildqatar@yahoo.com marry_poppins@qatar.net.qa (yes two "r"s) Also, is there a Qatar Embassy in Canada? If so, give them a call and see if they can send you a copy of the Marhaba book. The Embassy in the US sent us one before we moved over. Lots of basic info on Qatar/Doha and pictures. Sort of a moving here guide.	1

Thanks for your help.	Actually, Canada doesn't have a Qatar Embassy. Apparently, the US Qatar Embassy is supposed to serve Canada as well. I emailed the Embassy in New York to mail me a "Marhaba" book. I'll see what happens. Thanks again for all your suggestions.	0
I'm moving to Qatar in early 2008 from Canada. Can someone advise me of some good nurseries in and around the Qatar Foundation? Names/contact info would be good. Are any of them walking distance? Thanks for your help.	Visited (along with a few others) when I was over for my job interview in Nov. Really really impressed with the setup, but I believe that even the waiting list is closed until March 08, so worth giving them a call. Our baby is 9 months, so we're looking to get him in there from April/May if possible!	0

Are there any companies offering daycare facility to their staff? im currently searching for a new position and I am interested in working with such employers .. Thank you	guys thanks for your replies ... molten I would feel better and mainly i ll be more productive while having my kids crying ''near by'' rather than spending my day worrying and imagining the worst. Obviously these companies have separate organized daycare places it's not like bring your kid to office day ... We have some companies like that in Morocco and I'm thinking there must be some in here as well Boxbe I respect your point of view but I totally disagree with it, daycare can only help reduce the stress level for working moms (and some dads whom care enough) , just like having a staff lounge or a gym. It ll mak business a little more human I don't see why it should reflect any negativity on its image. Unless you think a woman's place is at home etc ... then I won't debate it. Its true my kids need me that's why im searching for better job environment khalliwalli ... i really hope u r wrong. i don't see why they wouldn't do it since Qatar is pretty much family oriented .. from what i have seen. and it's not like they can't afford it ?	0

Are there any companies offering daycare facility to their staff? im currently searching for a new position and I am interested in working with such employers ..

Even , you call your mother / sisters / teeny cousins etc to your place , a new baby is a bundle { & source } of joys and fun for the whole neighbourhood ..... ............ no baby will be interested to hear the high heels noises at that stage .......................

Are there any companies offering daycare facility to their staff? im currently searching for a new position and I am interested in working with such employers .. Thank you	Boxbe do you really wana be this judgmental and question the need for a mother ? daycare is what parents want it to be. Not everyone see it as a way to get rid of their own kids. It is a way safer way to return to work rather that maids. I have seen horrors in some nurseries which were not cheap at all so I wouldn't put my children in there for anything in this world. So yeah mothers might need help with the kids but it doesn't make us unfit it just makes us human. Molten I have made the choice to be at home since I had my first son and I thought I would do it again. 2 twins later i'm being outnumbered by babies even with a maid and let's face it money is gona be a major issue soon. bringing my mom was temporary and expensive ... we are expats there is no cousins sisters around ... so we need a permanent solution. i should say my elder (1.5 yr) enjoys other toddlers company so it ll be a great way for him to socialize.. the high heels noise is a good point though	0

Are there any companies offering daycare facility to their staff? im currently searching for a new position and I am interested in working with such employers .. Thank you	Better to leave your kids at home with an illiterate maid who beats your kids than in a workplace controlled daycare center staffed by professionals. That's the mentality in this country. You can tell by the way the kids behave in the malls! Unfortunately Samia most of the people in this country still believe that a woman should be in the home cooking and cleaning, and sadly they actually don't even know what a workplace childcare facility would mean. They come from countries with, umm, different, values.	0

Hi all.. We have a young baby [ 2 months old]. My wife has to resume work by the middle of September. We are looking for babycare options here. Is there any babysitting facility available in doha?	There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place, and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny, which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.	1

Am looking to move to Doha, and the company says they only pay for the employees private medical insurance. When I asked about the family, they said the national healthcare was only a 100qar per person and I could get that for my wife and kids... Am moving from Singapore, being offered 40k base + housing, car and 75% of kids edu. We are stuck on this topic of med insurance. Any thoughts?	The national health is passable for emergency care but for routine and elective procedures, private is the only reasonable option. 40k base is not enough for a family to live on even with the benefits you mentioned.	1

Yes 40k is not enough...plus private Medical facilities here are too costly..National Healthcare is for the Govt Run Hospital Called Hamad Medical Corporation. If you go for a routine checkup..you may end up staying there for around 5-6 hours..better think of this twice as moving with Family would be a very big decision without proper Medical facilities.	1

Hi I am a British expat living and working in Doha for 12 years and we have always had our local health card costing Qr 100 . People are spoilt here with having private insurance and don't know how good the local services are. Why pay for a private clinic.? All they are interested in is making profit. Go to the government run clinics and everything is subsidised by the government here. Money is no object! You get the best. I have had two major operations done here in Hamad hospital. I have been going to a local clinic for 12 years and had excellent care. They refer you straight to a specialist if they suspect anything wrong. I have had in the last month a colonoscopy, and endoscopy , seen a heart specialist and had a complete medical to check there is nothing going on that could cause future problems. All because I am over 50 and these checks can save lives in the future. Excellent care here. This would never happen in the UK. You would be on a wait list for a year at least to just see one specialist and have one procedure. Each procedure , done under sedation only cost me Qr75 . For a paltry sum of Qr100 I recommend the health care in Qatar. Of course you wait a little when you go for your check up. Not like the private hospitals, but for the standard of care here it's well worth it.	1

You pay 100 QR and get good services. Even if you have private insurance, some time private hospitals can not handle your case and refer you to Hamad Medical Corporation.	1

A block visa ... are set of visas of different job categories approved by the Ministry sent to the employer's agency in whatever country the visa was given. Now, when the employer needs an employee, he can use the visa already pre-approved by the Ministry, just like the case of working in Saudi Arabia.	0

In 9 months I finish my 2 year contract with the present company. If I have no wish to continue working with them after this 2 years may I change the company and not get the 2 years ban? I mean ... if I respect my 2 year contract and at the end of the contract I do not wish to continue will I still need NOC to avoid ban for 2 years? Can't I just leave the country and come back in the same day? NOC is not applicable in my case as I was so politely informed by the HR. :) Thank you everyone.	Go to the UAE where after 3 years you are legally allowed to change sponsor without an NOC being required. Abu Dhabi is booming, a couple of months away and I don't recognize new roads or buildings anymore. Qatar is now falling 10 years behind the UAE in every passing year. You can go to the UAE even if you are banned in Qatar. Send all these slavedriving sponsors to hell and let them do their work themselves!!! Good luck!	1

Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	when it comes to food. Progressive country,nice malls. Accommodation is costly though. So you'll be working as what?	1
Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	Yes, Nice and clean city Very green and you do not have to worry about transportation A lot of taxis and MRT (train) system is efficient Plenty of shopping malls (no family day rules) and entertainment outlets expect your working environment to be fast moving and people there tend to be workaholic (expect to work overtime)	1
Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	the cost of living is very high. And yes, accommodation is steep! my husband and I stayed there for 2 years, and we weren't able to save much. but transport system is the best -- you will hardly feel the need for a car :P sights and tourist spots are incomparable; shopping is amazing -- all the big brands are there -- a bit expensive though; food selection is wide and soo yummy :) As far as I remember, income tax for expats is around 15% per month. But at the end of the year, all the tax you paid will be given back to you, and you just pay the government 15% of that amount. That why we looove tax filing season in Singapore, like the months of May to June, because you get back all the tax you paid so it feels like Xmas bonus that time of the year. And you remit only 15% of that to the government :D ***lucky*wifey***	1
Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	accessible, drivers are smart & cautious to drive. Very systematic when it comes to office transactions.	1
Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	it's also a fine city -- or a "city of fines" as they say, because everything has a fine (eg. smoking in certain prohibited areas; disposing of garbage --even a cigarette butt; jaywalking, etc.) Cameras are all around so people are really law-abiding because of fear of slashing :P you will hardly see uniformed policemen roaming around because they have a lot of Civilian police; and since there are cameras everywhere.. crimes are very minimal. oh, and chewing gum is prohibited in the whole country. I personally tried to sneak in small pack of HappyDent from Malaysia, and their xrays saw it. Amazing! My husband almost disowned me! haha ***lucky*wifey***	1
Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	nice place, very clean, urban living. although small but Malaysia is up north accesible by causeway and have thosand of places to go. a lot of singaporean spend their weekend in nearby malaysian state of johore bahru or even driving 5 hrs to kuala lumpur	1

Good afternoon Guys Has any one of you been to Singapore i have just been offerd work there, any one any ideas what its like to live and work there ??????	1. A very Clean City 2. Goverment impose Income Tax 3. "Nothing is Free" you want something you have to pay for it, try using the MRT toilets. 4. A vast variety of food to choose. Try the Chili Crabs. 5. Electronics are cheap and updated. The Great Singapore Sale 6. Justice System is swift and fair, any dispute is usually settle within a week max. 7. Public Transport is very efficient Second to Japan in my opinion. 8. Singaporeans are very polite and well-mannered. All of them served the Armed Forces until a certain age expect some locals to be recalled for "Active Duty" every now and Then. 9. Cost of Living is very Steep, most of your income will go to your monthly rental unless company provide you one. 10. Family Entertainment is perfect. 11. Night Life is well and alive. 12. No restriction in buying Alcohol. 13. Just avoid the bubble gum and the temptation to take any flowers and/or fruits from the trees located within the city. That spell trouble if you get caught. 14. The Red Light District is Sanction by the Goverment. All the "employees" have permits, pay and fill-up their income taxes form. Mostly expats 15. Over there Durian is the King of All Fruits. OK LAH..	1

We're Candians and about to move to Doha (well in the next couple of months). Is there a Candian group there? Do many Candians live in Doha?	Don, I'm English but living in Turkey. I spent 15 years with the old (Qatar General Petroleum Corporation...now QP and that covers the entire oil/gas sector) and yes there are ups and downs. Social provisions (Company facilities) have deteriorated over the years but the developments in Qatar have probably made up for that. Another plus is that the country is now far more tolerant of Western behaviour and habits. Be warned about the housing costs. QP at one time provided free housing and utilities (including phone line rental). They then applied a limit to electricity and water useage after which you pay and I'm not sure if they pay for the phone line now (unless it's required for the job). If housing is provided I suggest that you take it. You will see from other posts how the cost of housing has risen. Ask QP all the questions to which you require answers. Whatever you decide to do.......... good luck.	0
We're Candians and about to move to Doha (well in the next couple of months). Is there a Candian group there? Do many Candians live in Doha?	Yes they pay for the phone rental. My husband used to get 6500 QR for housing allowance, now going up for 9000 QR. We find it is not enough to get a villa in a compound. 4 yrs ago 6500 QR you can rent beverly hills, but now you lucky if u can stay in 3 bedroom flat. QP used to have falcon club for the recreation for the staff. Now they demolished that and there is no replacement ever since.	0
We're Candians and about to move to Doha (well in the next couple of months). Is there a Candian group there? Do many Candians live in Doha?	Novita, do they also pay for cable TV (or satellite) and high speed internet ADSL service (or wireless) ? Thanx! Moudir	0
We're Candians and about to move to Doha (well in the next couple of months). Is there a Candian group there? Do many Candians live in Doha?	Don I am a canadian based in Montreal. I will be going to Doha for a two day visit next week for med exam, orientation and i guess final negotiation. I will probably join QP in June. Any room for negotiation with Qp over compensation package , if you have done this part?	0

Hello my friends, i hope you are having a good weekend. does anyone know how much time does it take to change sponsorship? it is taking me around 7 weeks and it is not done yet. I have an arabic passport and i gave the CEID my NOC and all papers needed.	Who is doing the whole thing for you? The HR department of the company you are planning to join? This is weird. Normally it takes up to 14 days for the CID, and then 1 week for the Labour Department and another week for the Immigration department. 7 weeks is a bit too long so you'd better check with the comapany you are planning to go to and ask them what is going on with your paperwork. Mine was rejected once and took less than that.	1

Hello my friends, i hope you are having a good weekend. does anyone know how much time does it take to change sponsorship? it is taking me around 7 weeks and it is not done yet. I have an arabic passport and i gave the CEID my NOC and all papers needed.	Mine was rejected because of Qatarization issues. Since the company I am joining is not meeting its target, the Ministry of Labour decided to block most of its overseas hiring, therefore mine was blocked. It took them around 9 days to issue the rejection, and then 4 more days to change their mind when my company submitted a letter inviting them to review the situation. What I would say is that your application is stuck with the CID normally. It might take them few more days to process your papers. In the meantime ask your company if this is normal. If they tell you this is fine you do not need to worry about it then it is fine. The only problem would be to manage your situation financially during this time, as I assume you are now paying your own rent.	1

They would have to sit on that bus going around the houses having probably woken up about 5am in the morning !!!!!!!! Then of course they would have the same long and tedious journey home!!!!!! If they car in a private car the journey takes takes only 35 mins! Now tell me what would you choose, bus or car??? Alot of employees are also given their accommodation and are unable to live near the school and this in turn increases the volume of traffic on the roads. We could also ask, why are so many schools built next to each other. It is not unusual to see 6 schools built right next to each other and drop off and pick up is nothing short of a nightmare. I can't understand why planning permission has been given to allow this! Personally i think that schools and offices should have different starting times but that's only my opinion.	1

And it's true some schools are so near each other built (e.g. Qatar Intl Sc.&Lebanese Sc...)that we lose most of the time with parking and waiting in queue...anyway, I would like that QIS will have the transportation service which they don't:-( It will be good to become mandatory but to have an experienced driver and a perfect schedule to collect kids at time from close/neighborhood areas in order not to wait & travel like crazy, poor of them!	1

The other suggestion is to set apart the school timings from office timings , if this is the major cause of all the problems.	1

When you remove the battery, the memory loss the sync data with the car's immobilizer, hence your key will not start the engine, and your remote won't work. You might still start the engine but it will shut off right after. You can program yourself if you can follow the instruction correctly. Instruction: google, is your friend. OR this instruction:(work for my 2000 model beetle) Insert main key into the ignition lock & switch on the ignition (do not start engine). Using second key lock the vehicle from the outside manually. Hold door locked for 15 seconds. Release key. Press unlock/lock one time, wait at least two seconds or more. Press unlock/lock button, wait at least two seconds or more. Manually open car using key in door lock. Remove key from ignition. Test your remote.	1

What is the procedure to extend a 14 days visitor visa to 28 days? Original visitor visa was issued at the airport immigration office before the visitor's arrival. To extend does he need to go himself or can the sponsor do it himself. What is the procedure? Thanks in advance.	Its better if the sponsor goes to the immigration to extend the visa but firstly the sponsor has to fill (get it typed) the visa renewal application form and sign it. You may submit the renewal form to the immigration pay QR. 50/- and the visa will be extended for another 14 days.	1

Thanks in advance.	so I hope QHell wont mind me tagging my query on to this thread and maybe will have the answer I'm looking for. I have invited my sister to visit us in Doha in January. I haven't booked her flight yet and know that we can obtain a 14 day visitor's visa for her on arrival at DIA. My question is this. If she would like to stay for, say, 3 weeks and so I book a return flight for that duration, what happens at DIA when she arrives with a return ticket dated 3 weeks after her arrival? I can see from QHell's post that it shouldn't be a problem to extend her Visa at the Airport AFTER her arrival but, if immigration see her visit is for THREE weeks, will they still issue her with a TWO week visa irrespective of what her ticket says? Grateful to anyone who may have the answer to this. QHell? What was the duration of YOUR visitor's return flight ticket, please. I guess it was for a stay longer than 2 weeks, otherwise you wouldn't have wanted to extend the Visa. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]	0

I will purchase her ticket before we leave the UK and I'm trying to find out if it's OK to book her for a 3 week return ticket. It's my understanding that you can only get a Visa for 14 days on arrival, but then extend it later if you want to. What I'm asking is if it's OK to book her ticket for a 3-week return, even though the Visa will be for 14 days (initially). Will immigration query her ticket. Do you see what I mean? lol OH! And if you DO mean the ticket, then it would cost me a LOT more than QR100-200 to change the return date. I buy the cheapest ticket I can and those aren't 'changeable' unless you pay a lot of money to do so. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]	0

Even though I told them I was here for 2 weeks holiday and my ticket had the return date on, each time at the airpot they automatically gave me a month visa. One of the times my Mum was with me & they also gave her a 1 month visa. So I would presure that they will automatically give your sister the same. Unless anyone else know different.

Are there any charges if you buy stuff whether electronics / clothes etc from either ebay or other online stores. If so what is the percentage, is there a minimum ceiling like 100 riyals or is all very arbitrary and random on what happens? Thanks	Courrier Services Companies do not have to declare anything of a value less or equal to USD 2,500. Above that value, they have to declare it and 5% custom fee would be due. They usually pay it for you and then on delivery you would reimburse.	1

If so what is the percentage, is there a minimum ceiling like 100 riyals or is all very arbitrary and random on what happens? Thanks	The service is good, reliable and let's say 4-5 times less expensive than their own shipping rates without this facility. First 1/2 kg costs you 8 dollars and it is 5.50 for each additional 1/2kg. Mind you, when it comes from US, the weight will be in pounds, so how they calculate the charge, beats me. The fact is that I have never paid more than 70 reals for my purchases from Amazon.com. Be careful, though, don't get your mailbox address on a junk mailing list, otherwise you will end up paying 8 dollars per each crappy catalogue or leaflet which will come on your name. I buy everything from Amazon.com (and most of the companies do sell through amazon.com) and nothing happened so far. Timewise it takes the package approximately 3-4 (rarely more than that) days to get to Doha, from the moment it arrives in your mailbox in US. UK takes 1-2 days. So far I am very happy with their service. My only complain is that they don't deliver, you have to go and fetch it yourself. But they do send you SMS, and there is tracking of items in your mailbox online. Check them at www.aramex.com/shopandship/ There is one more service www.ushopweship.com Supposedly they filter junk mail, but being happy with Aramex I have never tried them.	1

Thanks	Camel Jockey the 551 QR was clearly not just for actual, Qatari customs duties which are only 5%, even when they apply. Perhaps you could ask what they related to? i.e. export duties from the country you bought from? sounds suspicious to me although the "and charges" usually means they dont have to justify anything to you.	1

Paid 110QR for shipping cost for a 5 lbs. item. Here are some more details regarding the Shop&Ship service and a comparison to Amazon shipping. Basically, it is cheaper to have Amazon deliver your items to your Shop&Ship address (esp. if you're qualified for free shipping!) and have Aramex send you your package here.... read more here...It also tells you some steps you need totake to activate your account with them after registering with them online.

Thanks	Princess - I'd registered online for Shop&Ship and just like you I had no idea on how to get the account activated. A few emails later one of the local Aramex guys called me and said I will have to come down to their office (Salwa Rd.) with a RP copy and sign on a form. Terramax - Is there some method by which you tell Aramex when you want the contents of your mailbox shipped, instead of automated shipments? I'm worried about the junk mail you've mentioned.	0
Hi, I have an Aramex US mail box for mail forwarding, and I want to buy some computers stuff from Amazon.com or Ebay.com using my HSBC Internet credit card. The problem is that most sellers will not ship to an address other than the credit card billing address that is here in Doha of course. I asked the bank if they could add my US mail box in their files, and it seems it is impossible. Is anybody making such online shopping ? Can anyone help me with this issue? Thanks for your replies.	I guess this has been answered in one of the threads. In any case Amazon will ship any orders to your US mailbox in Aramex even when you make payments using your HSBC Visa Card. The Billing and shipping Address could be different. Have your Qatar Address as the billing address and Your US Aramex box as Shipping address. - HTH	1

All my current items from the UK are showing the following status:- "Shop&Ship Update Shipment is delayed due to pending customs clearance." Are you experiencing the same status update? Is Ramadan bringing S&S to a halt with customs sitting on everything? I am not blaming Aramex for this, and I haven't even bothered to contact them about it because it's beyond their control. I am just curious to know how big a problem this is by asking if others are affected.	it means an additional of 3 to 4 days of waiting before you get your hands on your items.

If it is medical / health / fitness supplement related item, they generally send it to the Ministry of Health that is in the HMC compound and you'll need to collect it from there. Unsure about other products.	1

I am just curious to know how big a problem this is by asking if others are affected.	My last shipment was held in customs for nearly 3 weeks in June (about 6 weeks before Ramadan). As mine were books and non-medical or food related that had nothing to do with the delay. Someone suggested that (a) the inspector (as in only one) was on holiday or that (b) a new competitor with more wasta was able to delay the shipment. I don't believe either. But it was very frustrating waiting for it to be cleared when it normally takes about 5 - 10 days from the time I order for it to be available to be picked up.	1

Can anyone recommend a good music shop in Doha for acoustic guitars?	for any orders to Qatar Thomann charge 40 euros, so if you make a large order it is well worth it. If you keep the cost of the order below 3000qar then there is no import duty at all. I only once had to pay duty (200qar) on an order which was over 6500qar. I ordered a shed load of stuff for my band. DHL normally deliver the item directly to your address, if however customs are unsure what it is, it will end up at Q-post. Been there a few times. The best time to go is 3:30pm it is dead in there around that time..	0

It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	From what I have seen on the news, he is a reckless, show boating, coward. How the hell did this man become a captain?	1
It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	I've been watching the news also and its terrible that such a tragedy occurred. Bodies are still being found. I too believe that he should be held responsible.. The reason I asked is that a colleague suggested that at times like this, it should be each person for themselves.	1
It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	Is your colleague British? That is not the way we do it you know. As for the captain. He refused the request of the coast guard to return to his ship and orchestrate the ships evacuation. He should never have left. The captain is supposed to command his crew, and assist his passengers. Not leg it and watch from the safety of shore. Especially when it looks like he is the one who caused the blooming disaster. What a coward!	1
It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	The Captain should be the first one to step into the rescue boat/s. If he doesn't do so, how will the shipping company or the owner of the ship make him responsible for the accident and put him behind the bars and escape from the insurance claims?	1

It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	Avaya - I think that prosecutions and recriminations are the last thing on anyones mind when they are in the midst of a crisis - that comes later and the captain should show leadership by directing the crew with the passengers. How can he possibly do this if he has legged it to shore and apparently jumped in a cab and said to the driver, take me as far away from this mess as possible???	1
It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	I think it's a tradition but he should not be prosecuted for that. His crime is more of command responsibility for not following protocols and deviating from course that spelled the disaster and causing lives to be lost.	1
It seems that the Captain of the stricken liner Costa Concordia abandoned ship long before most of the passengers and crew. Many have died in the tragedy. So, my question - should he be prosecuted for abandoning the stricken ship ?	He WILL be prosecuted for that along with a number of other charges including involuntary manslaughter. As a point of interest, the penalty for abandoning his ship carries a maximum jail sentence of 12 years ........of course that is "without prejudice". He has to be found guilty first.	1

UNLESS   you require some specific medication.    Some pharmacies are the "country carrier" for specific medications.   I have found Doha Clinic Pharmacy to be very helpful.   Even when they do not have the medication I need, they will look it up and then call the pharmacy that is the supplier and make sure they have it in stock before they send me there.	1

i am a fresh pharmacist , can any body guide me how to get the pharmacy license for practicing in Qatar ? i had registered once with the pro-metric testing from supreme health council website but later cancelled the test , as some pharmacist in Qatar told me that it is useless for me	yes it is true that it will be useless because even if you pass the prometric exam, you are not allowed to apply for a SCH medical license and dataflow verification because one of the requirement is to have a 2 years minimum experience. better to have that experience first in your home country then come back after you already have that experience.	1

hi i am a pharmacist with 3 years experience being offered for a pharmacist position in qatar. the salary offered to me is 1,630$ which is broken down to 950$ as my basic salary, 410$ for accommodation and 220$ for transportation. is this a reasonable offer for me? i have been browsing this site and shock by the truth of the renting expenses as well as transportation scheme. the question is if you are in my position is it a reasonable offer? will i survive there with some 600$+ savings?	everything depends on where are you coming from if you are making such a money home than no its a bad deal if you are not than it could be a good deal ,,,'but 1,630 for a pharmacist is a bit low i think you have to share your accomodation in this case	1

Your offer is approx 6K gross. If you stay in a sharing accomodation, you won't be paying as high a rent as someone who stays by himself. Your other expenses all depend on your lifestyle and I do not see a reason why you can't save about $600 or a li'l more, if you're wise enough and live smart ;-) All the best!	1

Just curious what types of prescription drugs i should think about bringing over in case they are difficult to obtain in Doha. Are Anxiety Suppressants and painkillers such as Xanax, Vallium and Vicodin available through health care providers? What about something like birth control?	Ok, I do know that BC pills are available over the counter. I know they do prescribe anxiety drugs, but you have to find a psychiatrist/psychologist to do that and they are rare here. There are no phone books, so you will have to find them by GP referral or word of mouth. I don't know about painkillers. They might have them here, but they might be something you have never heard of. Hope that helps a bit. Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )	1

I have had Chantix shipped over here 2 times now. It's a smoking cessation drug. Customs will send drugs to the Ministry of Health and you will have to go and pick it up. The BC pills you just go to a pharmacy and ask and they will get them for you. The weird thing I encountered was my daughter has eczema and uses a cortisone cream for it and you have to have a prescription for that, when I could go to Wal Mart and buy it over the counter in the US.

She is currently having problems with acne and pimples because her skin is not yet accustomed to Qatar's climate... anyways, I just want to ask where can she find a store that sells a wide range of cosmetics, i.e. pimple removal, facial cleanser, anti acne cream, anti pimple soap... hehe, sorry for the terms, I really don't know much about cosmetics really... I just need to know where can she buy those products because she really is having a hard time finding cosmetics in Doha. Well, I have bought her many cosmetics here in the Philippines but our government won't allow export of any liquid substances/cosmetics. I'm still finding a way on how to ship those products to her... Can you please help me on this guys/gals? I will very much appreciate it, thanks!	0

I used to have this problem back in Saudi because we're living in Jubail which is Industrial area and the air is very polluted and it gives me big pimples and acne that I never had before but then my Auntie Liwanag told me to use this RDL and it works! use RDL # 3 for once a day for 2 weeks then move to # 2 twice a day for another 2 weeks then she'll see the difference. but tell her not to over do it.

Many thanks, debral75	@ han19 Thanks! Yeah, I think stress adds more to her problem that's why I told her that she must not think about the pimple problem because it will only add up. She also mentioned about the water in qatar, she said it's a bit different of what we have here in the Philippines. Whenever she takes a facial wash, she uses boiled water (cooled of course) for rinsing. The cosmetics that I would send her is recommended by a dermatologist, but unfortunately, our government won't allow it. @ kiarajane are you filipina? it looks like you're filipina because you know RDL, and Liwanag is a Filipino word... anyways, thanks for the reply... I would definitely advise her to check out the Souq Filipino shop and RDL of course... Many thanks guys!	0

Birth control is not restricted in Qatar and hasn't been for a very long time (15 years at least that I know of). Birth control pills are available over the counter, without a prescription, at every pharmacy. Brand names may be different than what you're used to from your home country, but there is a variety of doses and types. Condoms are in every supermarket and pharmacy.	1

Hi As per I know, here in Qatar birth control is restricted and any birth control materials like pil or others for female not available in farmechy. So we are asking our friends to bring from our native country. What is the best solution?	If your friend is already conceived and she would like to get rid of it in the very early stage then there is no way to get the medicine in any of the pharmacies or on counter. Qatar is an Islamic country and they do not allow such things here that is why medicines are not sold here. I do remember that they stopped selling such medicines in the begining of 1980. I know that in most of the countries you will get some medicines for bringing back the mestural cycle if you are in doubt of pregnancy in the very early stage. If you are talking about contraceptive pills they are available in pharmacies.	1

I think this means the car was parked in a dangerous place while people and/or items were 'loaded' in to or out of it.

The online system of the MOI is updated very late. Maybe as late as 3-4 months as of the date the violation was committed. I had the same situation, my ticket was registered online on Feb 2007, but in fact the traffic officer handed me my ticket back in Nov 2006!!! So, check the MOI site under Traffic Violations section.

Also, I thought that when you buy a car it is your responsibility to ensure it has no outstanding traffic violations, otherwise you have to pay them even it they were committed before you bought the car. I might be wrong about this though, or it may have changed. -------------------------------------------- http://tall-and-ginger.blogspot.com	1

Last weekend my wife and drove to Abu Dhabi, and I think I may have gone through a few speed cameras in the UAE. When we drove back to Qatar, I was expecting to be collared at the border but nothing was said. So my question is this: Have I got away with it or not? I hope the UAE traffic fines are not linked to Qatar MOI? But what if we ever go back to the UAE - will we be fined then? Or what about transiting through Dubai airport? Looking forward to hearing any help with this.	there are least chances of escape thru this..u'l have to be very lucky. UAE Violations takes like about 2 months to be registered with MOI Qatar. Indeed, its liked, the whole GCC as well.	1

I got a flash in B ring road appolo signal 6 months back but no fine, when iam standing in red for left turn from crazy signal towards appolo clinic, i mistakenly move my vehicle by seeing the green light for straight going vehicles and after flashing only i realised and stop the vehicle and move back. But no fine for that insident i think police will analize the vehicle movement where the camera also record like cctv.	1

Two of my friends got it but they were aware that they used mobile phone while driving in the city. They dont have any photos for that. Don't waste your time for the photos unless you have overspeeding or Red Signals.	1

I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	if Estafa is what MJ said, then what Human rights can do with that? Honestly, I think nobody can do anything about it, unless there is a legal written contract of lending/borrowing money. Even in this case the procedure is way too long and you might end up with giving to the lawyers much more money than you are owed... ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry	1
I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	You have 3 options. You may lodged a complaint or blotter with any nearest police station. If he is a foreigner, the police will give him a visit together with your complaint. If the respondent will not own up, they can file your complaint with the prosecutors. If the respondent is Qatari, you go to the Ministry of Human Rights and they will assist you there. You may also try your embassy which normally have legal officers familiar with local criminal procedures to assist you. Good Luck.	1
I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	well...i don't know if this evidence is strong enough from the point of law.. but it's better than nothing.. because he can say that you gave him this money as a gift.. than what? rimlaw, don't think that police will react so easy.. they need to make sure that their action is legal. he didn't STILL this money, she gave it to him...THat's why she needs a contract where it's cleary stated that money is LENDED to him, with the time frames and conditions. ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”.

I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	Qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region. It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts. For estafa or deceit, it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation, it will be filed with the Court of First Instance. You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer. But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit. If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience. Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants. Cases involving foreigners, civil or criminal are handled by regular courts.	1
I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	Evidence is very important in criminal prosecution. Oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the quantum of evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal prosecution. The rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken, your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan, and you have no case for estafa. The essential element of estafa is "trust" and "exchange of goods or money". Prove this both and you have a case for estafa.	1
I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	the formality or informality of your document is immaterial. What is material for your case to prosper in ourt is the substance of your document. It must show the nature of your transaction, mentions the goods or money he received, his name and signature thereon, and any witnesses to the transaction. If you parted goods or money based on his representations, and which you awfully trusted, and his promise or acknowledgement of paying you back, and he reneged on this promise, then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa.	1

Why don't we have a forum for health here in QL? Anyway, can anyone refer me an affordable dental clinic in Doha?

I love the dentists there but the price is too steep. So if anyone knows an excellent dental clinic that does orthodontics..please tell me where I can find them... Thank you all!!!

Good dentists are not cheap. Remember the saying when you pay peanuts you get monkeys??? Well that also applies to your dentist. You guys want to be paid for a good job done, so do the dentists. Your teeth are an important part of your well being. So you should get the best. There are several dentists that do a good job, which includes Dr Sarrah's clinic. They use the right materials and do the right procedures. Ofcourse you can try a CHEAP place but remember, they are taking shortcuts some where.....and in the end you are paying for it. I was discussing with my dentist the fact that there were so many new dental clinics opening all over Doha and if this was a worry to him. He said that no way, he was not worried at all cos he said that he had heard from the medical rep that the first questions these new clinics were asking: "What is the cheapest we can buy?" This was in relation to equipment and materials.....so......do you want the cheapeststuff used on you? No not me, I rather go to a reputable dentist and get a good job/treatment. However the choice is your. And by the way I am not a patient of Dr Sarrah, but I know she is good, cos the good dentists hang around together and discuss cases. And Dr Sarrah is highly talked about by my own dentist. Aisha-Taweela	1

My dentist (also not Dr. Sarah) has stated over and over how so few of the dental clinics in Doha practice sterilization of their instruments, have trained hygenists, up-to-date equipment etc..   That would scare me to death.   I would rather pay extra for these important points than risk my families health.  Be careful and ask more questions than just cost.  BTW  my daughter's braces--start to finish---cost 15,000 QR  for 1 year, twice the cost of her sisters  (2years -more difficult case) which were done in the states. 	0

Hi all, I am new here but was looking for some advice. I have decided that I am going to buy the PS3 but I am going to return to the UK in the near future and I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether it would work with UK games/tvs/power supply etc? Also, I'm thinking of buying it at Virgin in Villagio... Any other good places to buy?   Any help greatly appreciated. 	you really dont have to worry much about the NTSC or PAL systems	1

Also, I'm thinking of buying it at Virgin in Villagio... Any other good places to buy?   Any help greatly appreciated. 	I would recommend getting a PAL system since the UK is based on PAL. That way you are sure it will be compatible with games and TVs back home.    ---Please read our Community Guidelines before posting on Qatar Living . It will save us all a lot of pain :)	1

Any other good places to buy?   Any help greatly appreciated. 	yep american models are NTSC but 110v and the ones you buy here are NTSC and 110v or you can buy the asian version. You'll notice the difference from how they are packed. US versions have free games and the package is black, while asian version are somewhat ash and no free games,just the console and are 220v. About the NTSC or PAL. You really dont have to worry about it because newer TV systems Support both PAL and NTSC systems. If you have an HDTV in uk, then you got no problems at all. *unless you got those really-really old school TVs.	1

Also, I'm thinking of buying it at Virgin in Villagio... Any other good places to buy?   Any help greatly appreciated. 	Yes Qatar has 220v. But dont worry, I suggest you buy a separate Power Supply for your PS3 which would likely be 110v if you're taking the US version PS3. Power Supplies are like boxes, like the ones you see under computers. Computers need a separate Power Supply. They both got 220v and 110v. Make sure its 110v if you're going to plug it in 110v, DONT plug the US version ps3 in 220v, or else you'll get a brand new 500$ Paper Weight.	1

Im not sure if they have the 40gb models there. Better buy the 60gb. As i said Dont worry about the NTSC and PAL versions.  just be prepared for the sticker shocker	1

Also, I'm thinking of buying it at Virgin in Villagio... Any other good places to buy?   Any help greatly appreciated. 	Contrary to what Qatari advises, the PS3 is region FREE. Meaning that any region game will work with the ps3. Having said that, i think there are DVD movie restrictions. The PS3's voltage doesn't matter either because they have built in regulators. I myself have a white Japanese PS3 (bought in Qatar) and it works perfectly find with everything. Just make sure you buy an HD cable if you have an HD tv since PS3's don't come with that. The Middle East's standard system is PAL. However you can get NTSC-J NTSC-UC and PAL all over in stores. I recommend the NTSC-UC (US, for movies because they come out later). At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what you get. ___________________________ Click here for LOADS of Qatar info  I♥Q  &lt;-- (Expat and Local Info)	1

Hi everyone. I'm kind of stuck with this and any help would be highly appreciated. I have company BB with BB services activated. I'd like to tether to my laptop on which I have WIN7 installed. Found many solutions on all kinds of providers except Qtel. Is it possible with Qtel? Ty. Kind regards, Daniel	I don't have a BB, and I also I'm not on Qtel ( as I'm in Saudi ! ) but there is a piece of software that I use called Joikuspot. This basically truns your smartphone into a wi fi hotspot and you can then connect any wireles device to it. You can get Joikuspot Light which is free, or you can pay for Joikuspot Premium. Obviously the Light version has restrictions, which the Premium version does not. Once you install and run it, the mobile phone will connect to the interent using the phone's data connection. You then connect the laptop and you're on line. THe problem you may have, if it is a company mobile, there may be restrictions on the handset allowing interent connectivity. Most mobile oeprators will allow for 3G data connections, but check your model of BB is 3G, some are only 2G ( Edge ) , e.g. BB Curve 8520 is only a 2G phone ( older models ) .	1

Asus Transformer Infinity is a 10.1" tablet, should be the best, highest resolution, with an LTE (4G?) version available, But sadly it's still not launched yet (I'm waiting for it though). The Google Nexus is a 7" tablet made by Asus for Google, No 3G, but has the latest android ver 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean). Asus Transformer Prime is a nice Quad-cored 10.1" tablet with the highest brightness (should be easier to view outside) there is, but no 3G model, and there were some complains regarding Wifi & GPS reception. If I gotta buy now, I'd go with the Infinity, or Nexus Tab for the 7".	1

Hi, Does anyone know a company called Ras Gas? I am considering moving there with my family. Does someone live in that city or he has to commute to Doha? what about school for a 3 year old boy? I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	Hi, A friend of mine told me following : I've been in Doha since 98. I was employed in Ras Gas for 3 years as a contractor. They have a good package for new direct employees. The housing is situated in Al Khor (70 km from Doha) they provide schooling in their complex. As a company Ras Gas are one of the main employeers in Ras Laffan. They are present extending their trains to 6 which will increase their production facilities. If your wife can drive its fine, as there is not a lot in Al Khor (no shopping malls, big super markets etc..). It takes at least 1 hour to drive to Doha. Are you already in Doha or not ?	1
Hi, Does anyone know a company called Ras Gas? I am considering moving there with my family. Does someone live in that city or he has to commute to Doha? what about school for a 3 year old boy? I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	Hey Katuks... If you have been employed directly to Ras Gas, then just do not think. Its the best company here in Qatar and they have all facilities. The accomodation complex is excellent and have all the features required. Yes, its a bit far from the Doha city. But that shouldnt be a problem. Nowadays Ras Gas are shifting some of their personnel to stay in Doha. Maybe after a few years you would be the lucky one. So dont think twice. Go ahead and do your planning to join the company. When the package is excellent, nothing to worry. Cheers ... Bobby	1

Hi, Does anyone know a company called Ras Gas? I am considering moving there with my family. Does someone live in that city or he has to commute to Doha? what about school for a 3 year old boy? I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	I exactly dunno whether there is a Ras Gas compound as such. But I have seen some Ras Gas personnel living in villas in some of the plush complexes in and around Doha. Perhaps much better you find it out directly from Ras Gas rather than checking somewhere else...You could have a better picture then Cheers, Bobby	1

I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	Hi there, I moved here a week ago and commute daily from Doha to Ras Laffan as I work on the Ras Laffan industrial estate. Al Khor is quite quiet i think but if the compound is good it wont matter, the commute from doha isnt too bad, a straight run. McSunny	1

I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	Hi McSunny, I have been offered a 3 year position in Ras Laffan with Qatar Gas, I will be living in Doha. It's a good offer and I will be on family status... Can you give me some general insight, GOOD & BAD. What are some of the day to day things that are frustrating to you, driving around Doha? the Drive to Ras Laffan? The heat in the summer? How are the people? What kind of leisure activites do they offer? Thanks! SloopJohnD	0
Hi, Does anyone know a company called Ras Gas? I am considering moving there with my family. Does someone live in that city or he has to commute to Doha? what about school for a 3 year old boy? I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	Hi SloopJohnD, I have only lived here for a few weeks but will happily offer my humble opinion. I work on the Ras Laffan idustrial estate but not for QatarGas, so I cant give any opinions on QatarGas. It is based very near my company so the commute would be very similar - its not so bad, most of the way is easy - virtually the same road! Doha is the hardest part...the driving is crazy. With a family it is defitiely better to be living in Doha, everything you need is there and you can enjoy a good standard of living, all the schools are there too i think. The people seem ok, crime is very low and you never feel like you would walking the streets in other cities. There are lots of activities all over and if you join a club like the doha club or something you can get family membership. I cant speak for the heat in summer but I would imagine its quite unbearable - but with air con etc it should be fine - and the winter weather is meant to be glorious. There is a book which I got from amazon that came in useful called Qatar - the complete residents guide - that will give you lots of info and really is worth the money. One point which I didnt know is that you can upgrade your driving licence (in the uk anyway) for free to an international driving licence-you need to do it before you arrive. I dont know if you can email me or whatever for more advice but I would be happy to answer any questions. Doha is a good place to live and much better than anywhere near Ras Laffan, theres realy not alot there. Anyway, hope this helps. McSunny	1

I will appreciate some comments before i accept the offer.	Hi. Thought I would give you my two cents worth. My husband had been driving back and forth to Ras Laffan for 8 months. He come to hate the drive! Although it is an easy ride once outside of city, straight highway driving. The drive takes between 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic of course. We moved to the new Dolphin Energy compound and really are enjoying it. Doha is close enough when we want to go into the city to do whatever. Compound life is awesome! Beautiful homes, almost like a small town within the compound! As for children well our youngest is 18 and they are living in Canada, so we didn't have to factor that into the move. However, I would think that compound living with children would be fine too. Certainly would not have to worry about day to day things that you would in a city. Hope this helped somewhat.	1
My daughter has begun working in Doha since about 4 months now. Her salary is deposited in the bank chosen by her employer. She expects to work 5-6 years before returning to India. What would be the best way to go about opening a NRE bank a/c and transacting? Would it be better to approach the branch in Doha or in Mumbai to open an a/c? How to ensure optimum service in transferring funds from her existing salary a/c to the new NRE a/c? Which bank should we choose? (BTW, I am in Mumbai)	I feel doha bank has best exchage rate offer to india iam from mumbai also i do transfer monthly online thru it then you can open bank in commercial bank whhis has transfer facilty in with ICICI bank to open the ICICI nre account you can do it from here alos no need to go to india they have online facilties also. opt for the best one as per your need.	1

If u are opting for SBI, you need to visit Trust exchange and they will guide the rest. You can transfer the money from online.	1

(BTW, I am in Mumbai)	Dear Sir/Madam, I suggest you can open an NRE account with ICICI Bank or AXIS Bank. If she has an account with Doha Bank then money transfer is easy to AXIS Bank(Its easy for ICICI also, but Axis bank does not charge from their end).Also Doha Bank gives best rates for online money transfer.You can go online and open the account and AXIS Bank rep will call her and finish the formalities(If she gives her qatar address and phone no.I have account with both banks ,but mostly deal with ICICI Bank online(I am a resident for 20 years).If you have any more queries feel free to contact me at jmvince@gmail.com JMVince	1

So You suggest she should open an account with Commercial bank in Doha as well as ICICI Bank in Mumbai. Then she transfers funds from her bank (Perhaps Doha bank) to her commercial bank a/c. Then what happens? Does the money deposited in commercial bank appear in her ICICI a/c as if the two are one and the same or is there an additional process to transfer the money from Commercial bank to ICICI Bank along with currency conversion? Sorry for the basic questions but I am totally ignorant in this field.	0

So you should withdraw cash and transfer them using money exchanges outside. For NRE account in India, ICICI, HDFC, even YES bank these days are the best options, from services and network point of view.	1

Easier procedure for the money withdrawals in the branch, excellent internet banking with international transfers (Doha bank still doing it old fashion way with a hand writing form that takes ages to fill), international ATM withdrawal in EU (Doha bank has a blacklisted countries policy that nobody really knows why is some country actually blacklisted....). These are just the ones i can quickly think of	1

When I inquired, they said it was technical fault. This amount was adjusted after several calls & e-mails; 4) After few years, I went to the bank and requested to close my account. After the paper work, I asked to give receipt/letter for confirmation that the account was closed. She said in order to get the receipt/letter I need to pay cash. Then I told to her no need receipt close my account. Until now my account was not closed. May be I need pay cash to close my account.	1

Can someone please tell me the process of transferring a car onto my name. I have the no objection letter from my employer :- 1) How long is the letter valid for ? 2) Do need to get any forms filled out before hand ? 3) Do I need to be present ? Does the previous owner need to be present ? Can a Manduud do this for me ? 4) What other documentation is required ? (ID cards etc.. ) Please help since the car is still legally the previous owners. Thanks in advance...	As far as I know, all what you need is your ID and his ID with the old ownership card, you do it in the police station (Souq Waqif, or Madinat Khalifa), and it's just two minutes process, and it will cost you 200QR. I transferred my car ownership to someone else just last week, and I do't know if he did any documents before, but as long as the old owner is ok and present, Why Documents? Good luck.	1

Thanks in advance...	Thanks everyone for you help, I went to the traffic department myself this morning. That is correct, the new buyer has to be present with the seller as he is required to sign a document. He also needs a NOC from his company. In my case as I am leaving Qatar before the new buyer returns from vacation, the police have said that I can sign the document and leave it with the duty officer. On the return of the new buyer from vacation, he will just provide the NOC, produce all his QID, drivers license and the transfer will take place although I won't be in Qatar. Thanks all Putsie	0

How to send money in Indian bank account when u dont have a account in Doha.Is it possible through Lulu exchange?	2 ways you can send money one is through demand draft but the problem with demand draft is you will have to post it to your bank back home and the 2nd is through electronic transfer bank to bank both can be done through any of the numerous Exchange Houses.	1
Good Afternoon Friends, I have a problem can u plz solve this, that i came to qatar six months ago and i got my Qatar ID yesterday on my hand. but, In my id my blood group AB- but my blood group is O+. When i go to medical & Finger they didn't take blood for blood group checking. any way, In my id my blood group is AB- , but actually my blood group is O+. Now what i want to do? in future it is problem?	Generally everybody does a blood group test (It's a prerequisite for RP), didn't you checked your report then ? You must get your blood group changed in ID immediately, Inform your company HR or go to MOI office. Before going get another blood group test done at any clinic for 15 QR & present your report to concerned authority. Correcting the mistakes is for your own safety.	1

Now what i want to do? in future it is problem?	You can try to do the blood test in a private laboratory (about 10 QR) then take the results to where you got the ID from (Probably MOI) ... This can cause a problem only in emergencies, where they have to check your ID to know your blood group, so they can give you proper blood unit. Since you are O+, then you shouldn't get any other group than O because it can be fatal. So please, don't leave it like that.	1

Problem will arise when unexpectedly you met with an accident or need blood immediately, doctor will check your QID details & feed your body AB-ve blood & you know very well what will happen then. So better get it changed yourself or be after your HR to correct it asap.	1

It is indeed very important to get the information corrected as soon as possible. Both the HR and the PRO of your company are not bothered if you live or not. It is your life and you should protect it.	1

Depending on who has sponsored your visit visa. If your spouse then you can extend it upto a max of 5 months and then 2 weeks after that. Yes medicals just take 3 to 4 days max to go to immigration. Try after a few more days.	1

Medical Commission do not transmit the results immediately to the Immigration. Go back to Medical Commission and have your papers scanned...and there you go! The result will be in Immigration in a split of a second. Results are available in three days but they do not trasmit the results electronically. You have to go back to Medical Commission. Try checking your medical result also in their website, so you would know that there will be no problems.	1

After the checking (Blood and Chest Scan) I came back. Then in one or two days (Cant remember) I went there with the documents and two officers who signed my documents after checking my result in the system. Then It will be automatically updated to the immigration. Once you get the signature from authorized officers of Medical Council, the sponsor will receive a SMS. Then you can go to immigration. (This is all about 2-3 day process)	1

I am sure many QL members may suggest you to accept this offer but trust me, if you want to live a life with dignity and respect, you would not save anything on that salary.

I am really confused here as I read in other threads that those who earns 7000 QR monthly were advised by some that they can live decently in qatar depending on their lifestyles. And some of them though getting 15K QR were told that it will be very difficult to make a living there. I am a non drinker, non smoker, and in a very moderate life style. I might only need a car in installment just to come and go.	0

Hey guys I have been offered a Salary of around 18,000 QAR a month. I am single and will be there alone. Do you think this is enough money to save money? I will have to have my own accommodation. They will give me full health benefits and 40 paid days off a year (whenever I chose) and will pay for my tickets roundtrip whenever I'd like to go home. What do you all think?	If you are single and reandy not to spend anything of ur girlfriends then sure thats enough for you. Keep ur credit cards away from ur gf.

What do you all think?	18,000 isn't going to be enough if you have to pay for housing. Especially if you are going to be going out and socializing like you mentioned in the other thread. I guess you could share a villa with other westerns but you won't be getting anything nice by yourself. Just my opinion.	1

If housing is paid for then you would have more than enough to save. One guy mentioned on here he went to look at a 2 bedroom apt in a crap complex and it was 7500. He said it was terrible. From what I've seen, sharing a villa will probably cost between 4000-6000. Seems like most US contractors we see on here get housing included.	1

Hi everyone, I am from Hong Kong, and I had recently offered by Qatar Airline for the position of Senior Airport Services Agent. The offered is like this: Basic Salary: 3,900 QR Housing Allowence: 1,100 QR Transportation: 450 QR I am single, and I had a BA degree. I need to reply to them by next week, but I still have chance getting into other airlines in Hong Kong. Do u think the basic Salary are enough for living in QATAR?? PLS Help Me!!! I am under heavy pressure by finding new job	If you can get a job in HK, i would say you should stay there. Your housing allowance not even enough to rent a room in Doha. I been to HK few times ... with the money you earn, IMO it is not worth it to come all the way here with the salary. Leaving your family and friends behind? Qatar is not a cheap place to live ... i can say nearly not far off from HK in term of housing prices. Price here for looking for somewhere to stay is crazy. And you will miss HK food as soon as you get here.	1

A two bed room flat rent will cost around qar 7000. for qar 1000 you may get a dormitory accommodation with many sharing. hope you get right company for sharing accommodation. you may, if you have frugal living habits, own cooking, etc, you may spend for living expenses qar 400 - 500. you may spend equal amount in taxi. even more if you have to use mobile call up HK. is this a direct job from Qatar airways or through a contractor?

I am under heavy pressure by finding new job	Hi leo55699, Qatar Airways (like other organizations) has its grade structure. It consists of 11 grades. I don't know the whole structure but understand that 8-11 are managerial grades. I also received an offer from them (we may joined the same interview section in Central ...). Their offer letter didn't say much background details and I kept clarifying with them. Suggest that you do the same to clear your concerns. P.S.: Personal thought is that you can definitely find a job with a more decent salary package than this in HK now. Job market here is good (from job seekers' side). Take care. F'co a little progress everyday adds up to big results	1

I am under heavy pressure by finding new job	Hi Think Twice The offer deadline for my job is tomorrow, and I decided to wrote them an email to nego for a better offer. Coz I still have chance to get into other airline in Hong Kong, therefore, I am not interested on going to Doha with a salary offer like that. Since I have to give up everything in Hong Kong, I think I deserve a better offer. What do you think?? and did they offer you a good package? Best Regard Leo	0

Either ask for more or stay in HK, unless you are really attracted about the Middle East. All the best. F'co. a little progress everyday adds up to big results	1
My Pataka/work permit is expired last June 7 and with the grace period of 3 months it will be expired again on September 7. My company seems so slow in renewing it. If they will not be able to renew it b4 Sept. 7 is it considered cancelled? or just an expired work visa only? If i go out of Qatar can i come back after sept. 7 with that expired visa? Is an NOC still needed if i will apply for new job here the mere fact that i was not cancelled? So confusing...need ur thoughts here...	Your bataka is already expired on 7th June. Yes 3 month grace period after which not renewed there will be fine. it will not be cancelled until and unless you permanently leave qatar, instead you will end up or your company will end up paying fine for the expiry. So let them renew it as soon as possible. however if can only be cancelled until and unless your company cancels it and your ban for 2 years. Yes noc is required if your company is willing to give. In your situation since they are delaying for RP, i doubt they would even give an NOC.	1

Even if your wife is working with 10000, you were not under her sponsor. She is probably in her company sponsor and you in your company sponsor. if you leave and visa is cancelled for you only ban for 2 years and not your wife.	1

Also no personal loan; no internet banking and monthly cut for no minimum balance is 20 QR !	1

Thanks	CBQ is a terrible bank. I tell you that I have been cheated by them. I took a car loan in 2005, agreed with them to pay certain installments (interest included) for 60 months, they have decided to increase their interest (from 7.1% to 11.2%) & decided to extend the period for more than 60 months without even informing me. Now most of their managers, and even their 'call center' is refusing to answer or reply my messages because they don't feel like recognizing the way they cheated me...professionally. Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing, there is a field…I’ll meet you there When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about	1

I just wanted to share a couple of things that we've been up to at Vodafone. Yes yes, I know, 'why is amnesia pushing an event and promotion?'. It's because I think it's useful to everyone. So Vodafone's brought back the 50Dirhams promotion. (call any country for 50 dhs until the 14th of February). Nice. Also this Saturday, everyone's invited to come on down to the corniche and enjoy a fireworks show! We'll also have a huge surprise for everyone! Anyway, I'm just excited :P	what time is the fireworks? and in which part exactly at the corniche	0

National day is finished. Lots of people think this year was different. Share with us, how did you enjoy it yesterday? Was it great? What you do/where did u go?	Unfortunately the patriotism and pride demonstrated by the parades, displays, activities, fire works etc. does not extend to actually keeping the country clean. The amount of garbage thrown aside at all these venues is astounding and disgusting. Mabruk Qatar on your National Day (a day late) - too bad there are so many who have no respect for helping to keep a clean environment.	1

I have become shamelessly hooked on QL and was just wondering what the most controversial subject has been to date? Who was it by? Which has been the longest 'living' topic? Has there ever been an Uber post?	That was started about two years ago and is still going. It was hilarious. It was started by an American girl (Redwing?) on behalf of her sister and soon degenerated into an argument between the sisters. Plus all the usual loonies joined in. Good thread.

I have become shamelessly hooked on QL and was just wondering what the most controversial subject has been to date? Who was it by? Which has been the longest 'living' topic? Has there ever been an Uber post?	Just read a few of the threads from the Politics/Religion forum - people are always making enemies and renewing old feuds in there! From the way some of them go off on one you'd imagine they'd rip each other to shreads if they ever met each other in person. It'd be interesting to see what would actually happen, as people tend to be for more confrontational when they're hiding behind a computer screen.	1

Has anyone been there yet? Tell us what you think? Do they sell signature items for cosmetics? bag? etc	I went to last years and it was ok. Good place to pick up carpets and artwork. The clothes and perfumes and stuff are all souk-grade so not really worth the visit. "How come I can pick my ears but not my nose? Who made up that rule anyway?

Has anyone been there yet? Tell us what you think? Do they sell signature items for cosmetics? bag? etc	The last day is the 14th if I remember the posters, I went today and it was full of womens night clothes, children's clothes, shoes, carpets and jewelery. They had some cosmetics and stuff, wouldn't say it was the launch place for new items or anything, probably good if you are a girl and want to dress up or a guy looking for presents who isn't easily embarrassed.	1

Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	Well Arman; nothing is wrong here with banks; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank; but I have made an extensive review of QIB; IBQ; QNB and CBQ. I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.	1
Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home?

When I searched QL there are so many disappointed and negative feedback from from bank clients I don't see the reasons behind it?? Regards;	0
Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship. Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them.	1

Actually on those open places there is no guarantee all the time. Even the area near the Ritz Carlton that we were going there before like 7 years [we were fulling 2 big Coleman Fridges which comes sometimes 12KG] it is now band. Good luck and if you know a new place; plz tell me. :)	1

Thanks in advance for your answers	0
Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!	1
Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."	1
Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	From what you all have said; Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore; to enjoy and witness its natural reserves. Thanks for the share! I'm really waiting and seeking for answers of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure. hawaii snorkeling tours	0

The Qatar banana island will be transfered by the end of 2013 to 5 stars resort called Anantara. Has anyone seen this island?? Where is it ? Is it near to Corniche ?	Why there? I have enjoyed many visits to the island; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy. I could be wrong; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future. On the flip side; the island is man made. So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport; and this is probably it. In which case; the owners can do what they like with their island. Well there ya go; I have answered my own question.	0

I'll be off to Cairo in the next three or four weeks; since my husband has been transfered there for two years? Did you love living in Cairo; or hated it? Why? How does it compare to Qatar? Tell me about it... (Desperately trying to find a Cairoliving website!)	The one thing you can be certain of is that Cairo is not Doha!!! We are talking about a city of over 12million where the traffic is so bad (if you think Doha is bad...just wait) its actually comical. There is also no system and it is one of the most frustrating places to live in. Hope you are based in Zamalek or Maadi which are the nicest parts. But the lack of a system and the 'pushiness' of the egyptians will make you angry and frustrated.The poverty is also striking. And yet; and yet; in one street of Cairo you will find more charm; more magic and more life than the whole of Doha. It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself (not surprising given its ancient history). It has the soul which Doha so lacks and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustrations. Egypt is a beguiling country which captured the heart of more than one roman emperor and many kings. Keep that in mind as you deal with the settling in period and once you .....	1

Celestvile; sounds like all the expat community lives in Maadi; and whilst I have heard that it is a quiet area with lots of greenery; I doubt it's convinient for us to live there as it is quite a ride from Giza; where my husband works. We shall see...we heard 6 October area is also nice? Besides; our housing allowance will only be $1500; which I think doesn't strech for a place in Maadi; and after living in a small flat for the last three years; I'm looking forward to a big place with a garden. By the way; do you have any idea where the french school is located? Dweller; oh god; now you worried me...with that kind of money I could live anywhere . Wonder why your son didn't like it.

There's no harm in trying anyway. Once you decided to quit; please be reminded that you cannot comeback within 2 years...	1

I also wanted to know if it is okay to go out of qatar with your friends both guys and girls?	For a skilled worker from philippines - the normal basic salary is ranging from QR 2;500 to 5;000 excluding housing and transpo allowances. For professionals - salary is ranging from QR 8;000 to 45;000 depending on the qualification and industry. I know some colleagues in oil & gas; banking industry and investments are even receiving between QR 50k to 80k per month. So it all depends on your qualification and work experiences. Good luck!	0

I also wanted to know if it is okay to go out of qatar with your friends both guys and girls?	Frankly speaking the salary offered to you is a meager one if Doha standard of living is concerned. For your food alone you have to shell out at least 800 riyals per month. Your personal needs is an additional cost of 200 riyals. So total you'll have a net salary of 2000 riyals or about 500 dlrs. Socializing is another strain in your pocket. But it's okay as long as you follow the good manners and right conduct of being a foreigner here. No public display of affection and you must dress up modestly. If you think 2000 riyals is enough savings for you then good luck and welcome to Doha.	1

"it depends upon your lifestyle actually..life here is much simpler compared in Phils..the cost of the commodities is relatively cheap and you can afford (almost) anything..if you have vices like smoking and drinking; then you have to consider to include in your budget..with regards to going out with friends from both genders; they're is no problem with that unless you do things which is ""haram"" and unacceptable here..also pda or no display of affection like kissing and hugging in public..as an added bonus; Qatar has been ranked the second most peaceful country in the Middle East; just behind Oman and the 33rd most peaceful country in the world.. so welcome here; kabayan!"	1

Thanks very much	"45;000 per month should easily afford you a very lavish lifestyle i would think. 10;000 a month for housing probably won't get you the pool that you desire; housing is insanely expensive in this country. If you must then i would put a bit of your own salary into securing the type of residence you really want; like novita77 said i would think 15000QR would get you a very nice place. you would still have plenty of cash left over to ""live it up"" esp if they are also giving you a car allowance like you stated in your post. QP is a well respected company that hires many foreigners. As every job i highly recommend you get everything in writing and signed by both parties."	0

The bonus is a new one on me if you are on an indefinite contract unless it's the Western Inducement Allowance (WIA). I think you will find the 45 days are inclusive of public holidays which is standard for Senior Staff.	0
Dear friends; First of all; iÂ would like to thank you all for your amazing help and support. actually i got an offer from QP and it was good. they have requested to undergo a full medical examination and i did that and sent them the report through courier. i just wanna know; what&#39;s the next step in the recruitment procedure and how long time it takes from then to issue meÂ work visa? I will appreciate if any can help me. Regards;	QP should be able to get it done for u in 2 weeks.	1

I will appreciate if any can help me. Regards;	NEXT STEP... I have explained this earlier and I will repeat it again..so that no one gets caught in an uncomfortable situation....Getting an offer and submitting a medical in QP is NOT a signal to move...Until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your Inbox..DO NOT RESIGN..I am sure in their Email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told... In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP...However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined..... QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times... The next step in your recruitment process is waiting and asking questions if you have any...Your VISA Could be ready in 1 month..or it can also be 4 months..so just wait..and DO NOT RESIGN from your current job....	1

hi all. I am planning on coming to doha with my 3 week old baby who has only got her BCG vaccination. I am wondering if its advisble to come and get the rest of her immunisations there in doha; or is it better for me to get them done here before travelling there to doha? has any one had their child vaccinated here in doha? thanks in advance xoxo	I would get all the vaccinations done before you come. There are lots of good hospitals here; so it is not a problem. However; I think you need proof of vaccination in small kids before you entry the country. I may be wrong. My thoughts are my own; but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.	1

I am wondering if its advisble to come and get the rest of her immunisations there in doha; or is it better for me to get them done here before travelling there to doha? has any one had their child vaccinated here in doha? thanks in advance xoxo	If you go to Hamad Hospital vaccines for kids under 1 are free. You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here; now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example; in the US they don't do BCGs; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer; but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!	1

Hamad; Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while; and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance; I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week; so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first; so bring the baby's RP; birth certificate; etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance; I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid; he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait. I used to go to Al Ahli but recently their waits have become hours long (with appointments!) and since they have a ""great"" kids play area; my kids were always coming home with some nasty sickness when w....."	0

For vaccination u need green card for the kid; for that u have go to Health commision back side of Hamad hospital ( from sports R/A to Fire station R/A; take right turn from Fire station R/A) approaching 200 mts one very big building. But yesterday she asked me r u from india; then she told it's in other place;i.e opp to Aldana hotel near sana R/A; one more medical commission is there. But they will give green card only and after that u have to go to u r regular health center; they will give the registrastion no and vaccination timings details. note: for issuing green card they need previous vaccination history record from u r county. if u have any doubts call to medical commision near aldana hotel @ 4312054 Thanks	1

how much will it cost the baby vaccination(regular). What are the required documents? they just arrived in Qatar last Jan.3(Sunday) as visit visa only. But my baby needs her regular vaccination. Can u help and give me some ideas about it? Which hospital or clinic is much cheaper? Thanks	first you will have to take the vaccination card from your country go to ministry of health; they will give you a qatari vaccination card; so you will be able to track easily what your kid took and what's remaining; and then you will be directed to the health centre near your resident address; this is free but the other option is the private hospitals and this will cost you depending on the vaccine from 200-500 QR and also you will need this vaccination card; also its asked for at admission to schools they ask for it.	1
I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.	1

I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar. They should have in their system what shots you need before coming over. It is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think (please excuse the spelling)	1

You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.	1

Also; if you have been vaccinated against HepB; tell them when you have your blood test as you will show as having antibodies. there was a thread about this a while ago; ask Apple for advice; she is the expert here.	0

"We had to have 3 different ones when we came from the UK; none of which I'd had previously in my life. I didn't realise there were ""usual"" ones in the UK. Now I'm worried I've missed out on some important vaccinations!"	0

Doctors also didn't advise me to take any. I think you should be good as long as you have had the ones you had as a child. And even if you didn't; your body has an immune system so it will be able to fight off the most not so serious diseases. TB would be smart to have though!	0

I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?	1

"We came from here from the US and had Hep A; Typhoid; and Tdap (combined Tetanus; Diptheria; Pertussis) on top of the usual program. The Hep A was a two dose one; given six months apart.

"One caveat - if you can (and there are official channels to follow) get your dogs here NEVER leave them alone or off leash - not because of them but because of the sickos who see the breed and assume they are fighting dogs.

I am so bored of the sun; I like it most of the year round but am going to feel cheated if you don't get any winter. (Also; am tired of watering the garden every night). Lala last year was lovely and cosy although I did feel bad for the Asian Games; it rained pretty much every day from 1st-15th December.	0

I would like to know if its normal to have a viral throat infection for longer than a week. I was told by the Dr. that this is normal in Qatar; due to the recent weather changes and dust. Is this correct has anyone else had same issue? If so what have you taken to get rid of this pain? Thanks	Take antibiotics ! The infection differs in some person. Some get over soon; while some last for long.	0

i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?	In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.	1

In his previous lives; he was a cat got abandoned near a dumpster by his owner. Sad story; really. QAWS is still operating but only until the end of September. Visit their facebook page if you want to see what cats are available for adoption. It cost 500QR per cat for their vaccination; neutering and microchip.	1

1. Where can I buy/adopt a cat? Other than the pet place in souq waqef 2. How much does cat grooming cost in qatar? 3. How much does vets consultation cost ? On average..	1. QAWS (shutting down end of September; so please consider this your first stop as they have tons of animals to rehome); 2nd Chance Rescue; Cats in Qatar; and Qatar Veterinary Center. Look them all up on Facebook for news and pictures of their current adoptable cats. Some ask a small fee to cover money already spent on the cats spaying/neutering; microchip and vaccination costs; and some are completely free. 2. Depending on the kind of cat and where you go; it can be from 75QR to as much as 250QR for grooming. More reputable places such as the big vets (Parkview & QVC) will charge more. 3. Anywhere from 100-500QR depending on what you need done.	1
1. Where can I buy/adopt a cat? Other than the pet place in souq waqef 2. How much does cat grooming cost in qatar? 3. How much does vets consultation cost ? On average..	Grooming isn't really necessary unless you get a persian or long haired cat. Save yourself the money and hassle and get a short haired Arabian Mau. They're hearty cats and you won't have a lot of health problems with them which will cut down on Vet costs. :)	0

Dear Dog Lovers in Qatar; Here's a query for u ..myself went to SQ WQF and fell in love with a 1 month old pup........he was so cute....dint have the heart to leave him there.... he was costing 1800/- bucks. Please let me know; if anyone has bought a pup from this place. Also; let me know if it can be kept in a flat ...since its quite small. I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	NO! A one month old puppy isn't old enough to leave its mother and anyone selling it knows nothing about dogs or their care or their health. You will be getting a sick dog that will cost you tens of thousands of riyals over the next months or years.	0

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	A better and more deserving place to get a pup is from the Animal care centre - it used to be called 'Paws and Claws' - not sure what it is called now. We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house. When we got him; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused. I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came; rounded them up and shot the parents; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre. We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup. He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter. There are good vetinary clincs in Doha; but still it is a bit expensive. Even then; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle; hug and love. If things go rough in school and her friends and teachers are mean; the dog is someone she would try to confide in; althought is cannot speak back.....	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	Buying a dog/puppy for your daughter is a very big decision. You have to consider many things before you decide on something. We have got a Shiranian (ShihTzu+Pom) for our 3yr old son; believe it was a very good decision; both are very good pals now. Factors: How old is your daughter? If she is below 5 years; make sure she have a toy group; very quiet and playful puppy. If she is bigger may be you can get a bigger one. Because size and attitude of dog will matter Is your daughter asthmatic or ill constantly? Get low shedding or no shedding dogs. Is she ready for responsibilities? Can she clean; groom your pet. If not; you should be ready to do it for her; so that she doesnot feel distant from her pet. Flat? Staying in a flat; then you have to definitely get a quieter dog so that your neighbours dont complaint against you and regarding toilet training you dont have to worry; it will be tough initially but be persistent and you can work it out. Use a crate initially to keep your pet and .....	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	Unfortunately the animals sold at Souq Wagif are in miserable condition so you will pay 3 times what you paid for the dog just to get it healthy. I was in search of a Siamese cat and bought a kitten there it took 3 weeks of hourly care and lots of Vet bills to keep the animal alive. Its a shame the govt. does not close it down its a menace to animal lovers. So don't buy the puppy and as stated its too young as well.	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	I wouldn't reccoemnt buying any animals from the souq. They are seriously mistreated (you only have to go and see them kept in the cages and sprayed with water to see that) and by buying one of these animals you are only further encouraging the sellers to mistreat animals. As others have said; there are better places to get animals (such as any of the vets who always have animals for adoption either in the centre or advertised on the boards). Finally; please consider if you and your daughter are ready for a dog. I personally; wouldn't have a dog in a my small 2 bed flat. I do; however; have a cat. Dogs must be walked every day (even in the heat of summer);. What will you do if you go on annual leave? Dogs are more expensive to be looked after than cats because they need more attention. Are you ready to pay high vet bills if your pet gets sick and can you afford the right amount of food every day? If you are confident that you are ready for a dog; then I wish you and your daughter the b.....	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY DOGS OR CATS FROM ANY SOUQS OR PET SHOPS! A 4 week old puppy should still be with it's mother. The chances are that if you take it home; you will get attached to it and then it will die. It's too young to be away from it's mum; it's too young to be vaccinated; it won't have had proper puppy formula or health treatments. Please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dogs and puppies in the souqs. They are normally sick; not vaccinated or too young. Some have diseases that can be passed to humans and you never know if the dog maybe belongs to somebody already and it has been stolen/found and sold to the pet shops. If you seriously want a dog and are ready for the committment for the next 15 years; please contact one of the animal rescue groups or adopt a pet from a family.

Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly. I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?	Insurance is between 3% and 4% a year...and seriously; while the driving keeps you on your toes...it isn't THAT bad!	1

Is that a percentage of the cost of the car? It can't be much worse than the M25 in the UK during rush hour; that's pretty much a 80mph free for all anyway!	0

Yep...as a percentage of value of car. I recommend you first hire a car for a week or two so you get used to the roundabouts with someone elses wheels *g*	1

I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?	Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	1

Life only can be understood backwards; but must be live forward. Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean. We pay around 2000 QR for our cars. Again our car are not a posh car. :-)	1

I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car. You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers. Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK	1

I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?	Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.	1

When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.	1

While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?	there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.	1

I see children with no seat belts on all the time. Jumping up and down in the back; on someones lap in the front and leaning between the 2 front seats from the back!!! Do some parents not care for the safety of their children or what?????

"in this region subscribe to. But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar (""Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows.""); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books.

If you're child was in a proper car seat you wouldn't have to sit in the back with it. It's dangerous for your child to be out of a car seat; front or back.	1
Just a question: Why don't Qatari people buckle up their children in the car? I even saw a lot of babies on their mother's laps in the front seat; this is too dangerous!!!

Just a question: Why don't Qatari people buckle up their children in the car? I even saw a lot of babies on their mother's laps in the front seat; this is too dangerous!!! Please do it for the children!!!!!!	There's an unenforced law where children under 10 need to be in the backseat. There's no law to where children need to be strapped into child safety seats. There's no awareness. There's ignorance. The sight of a baby riding in dad's lap as dad is driving is quite common. Quite horrific.	1

If people saw something like that and still didn't use seatbelts for their children; they should be warned their children could be removed from their care for reasons of child endangerment. That's quite shocking.	0

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sueño P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions). We'll have playgroups; Mums Night Out; and Expectant Moms Group; etc. There are no dues or anything like that. . .just fun :o)"	1

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	"This is one of my pet peaves...back home (Houston; Texas) children;according to their age; must be in a car seat. Knowing that this law does not exist here and how upset I would get; my husband warned me before hand; ""Now; you're gonna see a lot of children that should be in car seats and they're not."" NOT having children in carseats; in the event of an accident; can lead to paralysis or even death. Everyone should wear their safety belts. SAD STORY: (I was a high school teacher) One of my students; Eric; had just earned a full football scholarship to the University of Texas. One night; he was in the backseat of a mid-size car and had fallen asleep and was not wearing his seat belt. The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital. The others had been wearing their seatbelts and were not injured. Eric was paralyzed. Consequently; he was not able to play ball for UT. The UT law....."	1

Cynbob: My children are not to ride in a car without the right carseats. My first thought was to leave my car seats her in Norway; so that when we come for a visit the grandparents have seats for them. If I can´t be sure to get well known car seats in Qatar; I will bring the seats that we have here. A little more luggage; but nothing is more important than the safety of the children.	1

Nothing is more important and I believe that you and the others that utilize their car seats for their little ones (and big ones for that matter) are setting a great example...maybe it will actually ""catch on"" here! ;) Sad Memory: I remember getting to the hospital that night after another teacher called with the news. The rest of the family was there as well...how tragic...in time; the news spread of how a fellow classmate; a close friend to many; was not going to be able to walk and play ball. Others vowed to ""buckle up"" as we say in south Texas. They had learned a hard lesson. If this story helps even one person remember to take the time to use seatbelts/car seats...it was worth sharing. The Good News: He went on to complete his degree from UT. I last heard he was in law school with hopes of becoming a lawyer specializing in defending rights for the disabled."	0

To think that poor boy had the rest of his life ahead of him only to have it all disappear because he didn't wear a seatbelt. Who could have imagined that would have ever happened?

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	Why are people so careless with the lives of their children? I can´t undestand it. My mother-in-law walked the streets in our smal town; with a stroller; for four hours while she waited for me to get out of work; just because she didn´t know if she had put the seat in the right way; she didn´t take the chance. Never gamble with your childs life; I could never live with myself if something happened to any of my children because I didn´t use a car seat.	0

Hi everybody As everybody know; that beach is just a big dump of trash. Why we don't organize some kind off group that could take care; clean and protect the beach. Do anybody know where to start; and do we need authorization from the Government to take some action; like grade and clean the beach? Some money will be needed; if there is a start point I can participate with 1000 rials.

I think renting a heavy machine to grade; and remove all the trash; was a morning job; and everybody will profit it. Is unbelievable; the amount of broken plastic chairs; and stuff you can find there. I think the beach deserve our respect and protection; I'm not criticizing; but the damage is done; and action and not words need to be taken; every time I go there I bring my trash; and some times pick some plastic bottles around. Now there is a big dump of sand; maybe for construction. In a Country almost like an Island; not having a proper beach to go; is a shame. I can use Hotels; but to be honest for example the beach of the Resort in Messaid is worst; not only the trash but boats and jet skis like fly's. Check mate.....	0

I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking. I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution. Please don't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones. When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country (and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them); I'll gladly stop and lend a hand. -- Since Allah has given me a brain; it would seem like a sin not to use it.	0

Wait for another 2 years and there would be no need to clean the beach; the cleaning staff would do the rest and you had to pay to visit the beach :( Do not dwell in the past; do not dream of the future; concentrate the mind on the present moment. (Gautama Buddha)	0
Hi everybody As everybody know; that beach is just a big dump of trash. Why we don't organize some kind off group that could take care; clean and protect the beach. Do anybody know where to start; and do we need authorization from the Government to take some action; like grade and clean the beach? Some money will be needed; if there is a start point I can participate with 1000 rials. Maybe it seams like a crazy idea; but Qatar deserve it; not just come here and take the money	King Edshel - very true :) Ban Spoon Feeding not Me	0

Please can any one of u guide me properly... and how much time does it take to reach both???	I think so. If you only want to see sea beach then Dukhan is ok. There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan. Beware of Channa Fish! They are very dangerous; especially during the onset of winter. They generally don't attack humans; but if they are hungry they may eat humans! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and doesn't want to hunt; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey(the human bathers). If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic! Have a nice swim at Dukhan! Cya.	1

Hi can anyone tell if its okay to do overnight at umm bab beach? thanks!	hello there; as i do live in dukhan for quite long time; i don't recommend you camping at um bab beach. nothing serious about it but normally people don't camp there!plus safety wise your gonna be far away from dukhan if you need assistance.not good location too i guess around there to camp; but just wanted to let you know since you've asked; you could try further down dukhans beach after the beach house (after the QP sailing club)if you know what i mean good clean spots you could always find. anyways good luck mate have fun!	1

I have just had a call from Nissan Service Centre (Ind area) about the cost to fix my AC on my car - just shy of 20;000QAR!! Call me old fashioned but does this not seem rather alot to pay and it was almost as if the guy was glad to be telling me; like he was proud to rip off his customers. Please tell me this is not so; any thoughts out there as to somewhere else to take my car???	Nissan is a rip off; get your car fixed outside for fraction of the price. To fix your ac they will tell you ten other items need to be replaced; plus labour charges and you will end up keeping your car with them for a week or so. For 20k you can buy another second hand car :P	0

I changed manure; but in vain. put them in sunlight. gave them ventilation tried all tactics but they would just die away. turn black. watz happening can anyone suggest me?	Make sure you don't use to small or too large a pot for your house plants; I have kept plants in their same container for 10 years and they are fine depends on the plant.  Also you mentioned manure; you don't use manure on indoor plants; I hope you meant soil. I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a  while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.  Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.  I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now. There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant.	1

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs.

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Heamoglobin is a component of the blood. If you are deficient in it; it means that if you have an accident or cut yourself; you will bleed easier and for a longer period of time.	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Homoglobin is a prejudice against globin....... Its actually haemoglobin; a deficiency can be due to many factors.....if you are deficient you are known as being anaemic...google it for more details....	1

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	My mistake; confused this with the condition Haemophilia.	0
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to Heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess. They are responsible of Healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks. IF you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . There body needs Oxygen but the hemo. aint functioning in the way they have to .	1

Well..LP...understood but there are maybe's here in particular that desalination of seawater and brines within particular WHO regions and globally is a large and rapidly growing process for producing new drinking-water. There is a clear public health and environmental protection argument for providing guidance on production of desalinated water for drinking-water. There are certain chemicals and microbes that are of particular importance in desalinated water. Of these; particular concern has been expressed regarding the presence of microbes due to blending of final waters that; because they were derived from coastal and marine sources; may not be adequately addressed. Similar concerns have been noted about particular chemicals in source water or that are not well removed by the desalination process.	0

They are rather hard to see unless your are coming from the Corniche and you may have to jump the curb and park on the street side of the Mosque that is across from it. I highly recommend the Marhaba information guide (30 QR) it is a wealth of information and over 300 pages. http://www.explore-qatar.com/ also good There's a fine line between genius and insanity.

Does anyone know of venues for a kiddie party? Mcdo & KFC are already given.

Does anyone know of venues for a kiddie party? Mcdo & KFC are already given. How about a restaurant or a place where we can rent & have the food catered? 	Most of the play areas (Jungle Zone; Extreme world; Rays Reef) will do parties and I think you can specify food arrangements although most use the FF outlets. Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.	1

Hi; if you are to work in Ras Laffan; do you live there; too? Are there housing accomodations in the RL industrial area? If I look at a map; the drive between Ras Laffan and Doha looks to be 60+ minutes. Is this true? So if you live in Ras Laffan; what is the entertainment like there?	Depends on the company you're working for. They will have their own camps within RLIC; with their own entertainment and it's up to them who lives there and who commutes from Doha. It's about an hour and a quarter bus journey from Doha.	1

Yes; saving money is the priority . But I was just wondering what a person does around Las Raffan if he's on single-status and he finishes work each day. Are there some simple restaurants to go to if you don't want to cook dinner at night? Or; are there cafes to walk to just to relax? I'm not interested in any heavy disco scenes .

I've worked in oil camps before so I know what you mean about adjusting to the life. In other words; there is no way to take a bus or taxi to any small town that is nearby - like Al Khor - just to get away from the work site for a few hours? Sometimes it's good to get into a different scene for a while. Is there taxi service outside Las Raffan?	0

On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.	1

PARUL DESAI	hello guys;Im a filipino physiotherapist. parents should not be ashamed of having a child with special needs.If they dont do something about the condition of their child;they deprived the rights their child to have an education. In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old.

MANY OF OUR CHILDRREN ARE BORN WITH SOME HANDICAPS; WHICH REQUIRE SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL SKILLS; I HAD POSTED MANY CLASSIFIEDS FOR TEACHING THESE CHILDREN BUT THE RESPONSE IS ZERO; IT SEEMS PARENTS ARE RELUCTANT TO GIVE THE CHILDREN THE WINDOW TO LIFE OR THEIR ARE ZILLION SCHOOLS RUN IN QATAR FOR WHICH WE DONOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT. CAN SMEBODY HELP TO LOCATE THESE SCHOOLS???? PARUL DESAI	'I am Sam' is a wonderful movie and i think everyone must see that for their own awareness and specially those whose children or anyone around have learning disability. I can suggest one more movie if you can see which is in Hindi; it's 'Taare Zameen Per'. Cheers Sam	0
A friend of mine told me that there is a small kids nursery(age 3 to 5yrs) in Al Saad area where the Indian lady teacher slaps the face of small children. I think some parents do not know about this or some just ignores it. Does anyone has such experiences and can anyone suggest how to deal with this?	Report the teacher and take your kids out of the nursery!	1

We Indians have been able to contribute only because we have got slapped in home & school. We are here in GCC as the greatest demand work force in all areas in terms of skills; tolerance; business; management and above all compatability; because we have been slapped. This has given us the name of biggest and trustable employees among all the nationalities & are at par of all as per the GCC nationals say so. I'm proud we are Indians. Don't get dragged away by stupid man made rules when the creator has asked us to teach behaviour whatever way it applies. Kids are very soft and I like them more than you people who look really less matured to pass such comments. We create ourselves above the mighty knowledge of the creators who has many trillions years experience and we not even mature in the age of 40 - 50 years that we survive as adults. Pass comments only when you fell like being knowing more on the subject.	0

In what religion or what part of quraan or bible God has told u to slap ur kid. I don't think God would love the kids to be slapped. in addition; hitting kids is affecting him/her psychologically and make them lose their self confidence and can suffer from depression. is that what u want for ur kid??? fine; but u slap ur own kid. don't let a stranger slap ur kid for u.	0

Cheques will be encashed immediately on presentation at a bank irrespective of its issuing date; according to the relevant provisions of Qatar’s Commercial Law; which takes effect on May 13; 2010. According to Article 580 of the Commercial Law of Qatar (Law No.27 of 2006); the cheque shall be ‘payable at sight’. In the event the cheque was presented before the date set as its issuing date; the instrument shall be paid on its presentation date. If a cheque bounces for lack of funds when presented at a bank; the drawer will be liable for its value and he/she may be prosecuted; convicted of a penal offence; fined or imprisoned; sources said yesterday. The provisions of the law take effect in May next year following the expiry of the three-year period notified after its implementation.

What is the history behind the Crescent Moon symbol? What does it symbolize or mean? Is it a valid symbol for the faith of Islam?	"The crescent was not a symbol used for Islam by Muhammad or any other early Muslim rulers; as the Islamic religion is against appointing ""Holy Symbols"" (so that during the early centuries of Islam; Muslim authorities simply didn't want any geometric symbols to be used to symbolize Islam; in the way that the cross symbolizes Christianity; the menorah was a commonly-occurring symbol of Judaism; etc.). This is why early Islamic coins were covered with Arabic writing; but contained no visual symbols."	1

What is the history behind the Crescent Moon symbol? What does it symbolize or mean? Is it a valid symbol for the faith of Islam?	"""The Star and Crescent signifies concentration; openness and victory; as well as sovereignty and divinity. According to tradition; in 339 BC a brilliant waxing moon save Byzantium (now Istanbul) from attack by Philip of Macedon. To mark their gratitude; the citizens adopted the Crescent of Diana as the city's emblem. When the city became the Christian Constantinople in 330 AD; its Crescent assumed the significance of an attribute of the Virgin Mary. In 1299; conquering what is now Turkey; Sultan Osman had a vision of a crescent moon stretching over the world; it thus became a symbol of the Ottoman dynasty; and when Constantinople fell to Muhammad II in 1453; the crescent came to represent both Islam and the Turkish empire. The star was added by Sultan Selim III in 1793 (its five points being established in 1844)."" Source : ""Signs & Symbols; page 42; by Clare Gibson"	1

Some 27.000 lightyears from the center is a small star with eight planets. Go to the third one from the sun and find the continent of Asia. Look at the western portion and identify Qatar. Then find Doha. Once you are in Doha and found the Land Mark Mall enter the new highway. You will soon see the American Embassy on your right. If you pass it you have to do it all again.	1

I've tried Al Million Taxi so far it was a good experience. The taxi was on time; there was a text from them prior to the agreed time and the name of the driver with the plates. The meter was on and the destination was plotted in their metering machine. But yes since the driver was new he was'nt familiar with where I was going so I have to tell the directions. Other than that I have no problem with getting a taxi from them!	1

Had anyone taken rides with Karwa's new franchised taxis operated by Al Milllion? I have yet to take a rdie in one of these new franchised taxis. So I don't know about their services. Are the drivers better behaved than those from Karwa or Mowasalat? Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service. Any comment?	I wanted to talk about this topic anyway. Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away(Near Falcon Petrol Station). He did'nt know where mall round about is. He did'nt know how to change lanes. The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window. Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living. Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities... The taxi was new and clean. The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals. I welcome Million Taxi; with all its faults. Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa.	1

Looks like these taxi drivers were not trained properly before allowing them to drive around the city. Didn't know how to change lanes?...how were they able to acquire driver's license then?	0

They show their respect to costumers not like the old karwa taxi drivers which are arrogant and this new million taxi; they are not choosing their costumers! They charged us an extra 4riyals because they had two meters running. one is always 4 riyals and the other one start at 4 riyals. This is way better than the ole Karwa Taxi's! i hope they'll maintain their good image though.	1

The only comment i can make is that last Friday morning from decoration roundabout towards the Ramada Juction; one decided that he would try and cut me up and flash lights/honk horn etc. Anyway his number plate should you wish to travel with the uneducated sod is 3203. I have passed this to the police; thought that it may be better for me in the long run instead of ripping the ba@$#&%s head off... happy motoring.	0

Some of the stuff in Carrefour is aweful; but most of it is ok. Just cos it doesn't all look shiny and identical doesn't mean it's bad!

My wife and I will be moving to Qatar in September; can anyone give us some info of what to expect and basic advice? Also I am an ex pro footballer looking for a decent standard football any clues to contacts etc and how i get involved out there?	LewisHamilton; Here is an honest report: Be prepared to often put your patience levels beyond your limits in many daily situations. The driving here is insane and extremely risky. The professionalism levels are quite substandard when compared to the developed world. Services here are generally very poor. You will witness all around you; extremisms of social segregation and exclusion; where laborers and maids are marginalized and excluded from the main stream society. During the summer months (May to September) the heat is extreme; it can reach + 50 C. Many people leave Qatar and those who stay; stay indoors. During those months; life is all about work; home and shopping malls. No rain and sand storms instead. Your home and car will be covered with fine brown dust (as thin as cement or talc powder) when can damage your electronic appliances and your health. You'll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend (such as what you wear; what you say; what you drink and eat and when.....	1

My wife and I will be moving to Qatar in September; can anyone give us some info of what to expect and basic advice? Also I am an ex pro footballer looking for a decent standard football any clues to contacts etc and how i get involved out there?	In private (hotel) beaches; both for men or women; there are no restrictions (just like elsewhere). In public beaches; for men there is no restrictions. For women; its not so much about the official restrictions; its more to do with the fact that many people (guys) are not prepared (educated) to behave in the presence of a women in a bikini. Reactions and consequences may vary.	1

Mostly any beach in the Mediterranean Sea; some in Southeast Asia; South America and Australia... just kidding. Beaches here look nice in pictures but often there are not that great (mainly because of the sand which is earthy dusty and the extreme heat starting in May. Here in Doha city; they destroyed all public beaches and all we have left are the hotels (Intercontinental Hotel; perhaps the most popular; not necessarily the best as the beach is artificially prepared the sea floor is construction debris covered with algae. Recently they have built a series of artificial beaches; between the Intercontinental and the Pearl; in Qatara (a cultural village partially operating). The beaches are prepared to be public but they are subjected to a cover fee. All these beaches are artificial so expect dusty sand and sea bed with construction debris.

Hi; strange question maybe..I'm not in Doha yet but will be moving soon. Is it safe and accepted for a woman to be jogging outside; in the evening? And what would be a good place; I was thinking along the Corniche..	basically women are pretty safe to do anything around here. just be street smart and use a little common sense and you should be fine. Other options would be to join a all ladies gym; or a thread mill at home. Loads of women jogging along the corniche :)	1

Is running or jogging early in the morning or at night also usually done in Doha? Where is a suitable jogging/running place (suggestions)? :)	Wala naman sigurong problema kahit morning or nyt; basta safe yung lugar na pagjajagingan mo...May mga sports satadium dito na allowed ata; di ko lang alam kung saan.

I know that inline skating; jogging; biking ect... are ok basically anywhere in Doha but skaeboarding always seems to get a bad wrap wherever I go.  Is this the same in Doha?  Im not talking about destroying property or anything like that but it is often view that way while im simply entertaing myself the same as the rest.  Please do not suggest dune surfing; that looks like all of 5 seconds of fun.  Thanks all!	honestly ... i dont think i have seen anyone skate boarding here... but i know there is a shop on salwa road (i think thats were its at) i used to do agressive skating and there are alot of good places here to do some good stuff... i think if you just be respectful to people and dont make a big scene about it ... then no one should care... besides... even if they do say anything whats the worst that could happen... if there is no sign around... the worse they can do is tell you to leave...  ____________________________________________________ just hanging out and watching dvd's with helen keller... kind of a quite night.	0

Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	Qatar is no longer a safe place to live in when compared to what it was before. Seeing is believing. The other day my wife was just waiting for me to take the car out from the parking area of our flat( she was standing inside the parking area but she was busy on her mobile ) when a guy in a Honda Civic stopped and asked her to hop in. Do you call this safe. I have seen this happening to so many women in Qatar. No one is trying to scare away people it is the fact. Please open your eyes and dont go by statistics.	1
Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	Bibs; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar. This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something…) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....	1

Have I got stared at---always and it creeps me out; but never have I felt unsafe. I keep my head up; walk fast and in a confident manner.

Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....	1

Any other places where a man can get a drink on a thursday night?	I am going there and they didnt asked me for 15000 riyal membership...	0

Any other places where a man can get a drink on a thursday night?	But didnt really like it in there. So i though of trying out a few places. Went to cloud nyn; and got refused. Is there a couples only policy?? It was very irritating coz i called them up and they said singles were allowed..	0

Hi there I m pretty new to this place..... The world is getting small these days..... Although preoccupied with work ; are there any decent places to hang out here? Where can w find females for a date? How to go about it?	I have been here for about 8 months; I know a bit about the place. There are a few good bars to go to to meet new people. Of course you want to meet women. I hear the Qube is a good place to meet girls. You could try your luck there. Where have you been?? I don't want to tell you places you have already been too. Ask me any questions and I will try and answer them for you.	1

Hi there I m pretty new to this place..... The world is getting small these days..... Although preoccupied with work ; are there any decent places to hang out here? Where can w find females for a date? How to go about it?	Ok; well there is Garveys; a british run pub. More casual. You can sit down talk and drink they usually have a band playing. There is also Palomas; however you need a female with you to get in. Aussie bar this is in Rydges hotel; same deal as palomas you need a woman with you. What sort of music you into? At the Diplomatic Club they get djs from all over the world. It is usually house music. They also have hip hop nights. Shit I think the Qube for males is about 80QRs; of course free for woman. Your right you know; we are treated with so much more respect here than in my home country.	1

This has the advantage of opening some doors to you; if you are willing to go through any. like 25 points is the minimum you need I happened to learn to be a member of the book club. otherwise I have not read (could have missed though) anything about getting a prize with your points. I wouldn't suggest it. Its the quality I want more than the quantity. dont you? ;) Burnout. Beware! :)	1

My family and I are moving to Doha from the U.S. soon. What are some of the activities for teenages; ages 14-17. I have two in that range; and they enjoy sports...mostly tennis and soccer.	Doha has an overdone of sporting facilities! The Doha Asian Games are next year which means there are a lot of sporting facilities and events happening. Also; there are a number of sport and health clubs that you can join. Soccer is big here and the season is starting soon.

My family and I are moving to Doha from the U.S. soon. What are some of the activities for teenages; ages 14-17. I have two in that range; and they enjoy sports...mostly tennis and soccer.	I personally think there's lots for a teenager to do here. I think it's mostly like most western countries with the exception of all the bad influences (No alcohol in grocery stores and such). Apart from the sports that have been mentioned a billion times; there are a lot of other ones that anyone may join and most of the time get coaching for free. Golf; archery; shooting and a lot of other ones that are completely free. For the not so sport oriented teen; there's the Scientific Club which is like a club that allows members to expand their scientific abilities. The Scientific Club will die out soon as the new Science and Technology park is opening up soon and lots of major corprations such as Microsoft and Dell are taking part in it. Movies aren't half bad either. The real blockbusters make it here within a week; while other not-so-good ones make it here in 2-3 weeks. There's also Alladin's Kingdom which is an OK theme park. Isn't as great as many others but it's OK. This won't last l.....	1

Kindly someone tell me; specially if there is someone from pakistan; is there any visit visa available for pakistanis? i have asked many travel agents in pakistan;but they say they do not deal with qatar visit visa/no visit visa available. I am almost shocked because UAE visas are so easy to get; why not qatar visit visa for pakistanis?	You can get visit visas but you should have any blood living in Qatar. Otherwise; you have to apply for tourist visa through Qatar Airways and have to pay for hotel accomodation as well.	1

Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	Hmm for a second there; I thought TATA's did something crazy and actually launched the SAFARI in Qatar! Its enough I saw a couple of Scorpios on the road and I had to duck behind my steering wheel! Thank God it isnt so :) SAFARI is only good for India; gives the Indians a feel for BIG car.

Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	Tata cars do not have quality; none of them ever: The Estate; Sierra;Safari; Indica .... ...Avada Kedavra..	1
Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	"TATA are known to be a business house with solid Ethics.. TATA cars have proven to be success in Indian MArket. There Indica was the only car in India which challenged the dominance of Maruti Suzuki 800; which was enjoying the maximum market share. TATA NANO has shown to the world their Engineering superiority. Something even the Germans or Japanese Couldn Do. Safari is a Good Vehicle. But the problem in Qatar is - People are not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle does well on road... They follow the crowd... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese... You sell a toy car labelled ""made in America"" And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff.... Why you think Skoda is not a much accepted brad here very much like TATA.... First see the vehicle and then Comment.... If a vehicle can run on Indian Roads (sorry not roads.. supposedly roads) It can drive in any country ;... trust me...."	1

This was a new one to me.. Apparently; if your relationship is in a rut; then one idea is to issue your partner with a ""Hall Pass"". This allows him/her a few days of freedom to do whatever they want. no questions asked. Sounds dangerous to me; but what say you. Would you issue your partner with a ""Hall Pass"" ?"	"No; since when does ""doing what ever you want"" help to fix a relationship? It's just carte blanche for cheating...and cheating makes things worse; not better. IMHO"	1

If the 'Hall Pass' is for them to go on the lash or a weekend away with mates or some R & R away from stresses; then sure he could have a Hall Pass - as long as I got one too.

One should always be able to do what one wants to do; even if one is in a relationship. If it is a good relationship; one will not feel that there are uncomfortable restrictions. Being in a relationship should not mean one has to give up ones life or personality. If it feels that way; then maybe one is with the wrong partner.	0

Hello; I am aware of the catholic church; but are there any other christian churches in Qatar? Do they make joining/converting as difficult as the Catholic church?? Please help	I learned there are many types of Christian/Catholic in Qatar (Bible focus; Churches; International Church community; Baptism; etc). It is up to you. No one can force to change your religion; don't be afraid. We are all pray to the same God; the different are the way how we do it. There are no such force converting like you said. Religion is faith that comes from your heart; and what you feel in life. As long they teach good things which can make your life better; keep away from sin; it's fit for you.	0

Today's Gulf Times carried an article where recommendations were made to make arabic language and sharia compulsory in curricula of all expat schools in Qatar.

Of course he should learn about Islam; but not as something he needs to submit to; but something he should have knowledge about. The same goes for Sharia law. We do indeed live in an Islamic country; so it is important to be familiar with Islam. I like that Arabic is taught; the more languages a person knows;the better. The only problem I have is that so far all the Arabic teachers we encountered are totally useless.	1

How do QL'ers with school going kids feel about this? Make your opinions heard.	Isobel said R.E ... In order to teach religion effectively there has to be comparatives. What I mean by this; when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion. If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions; in order to get the history; culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion. There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level; debate as in e.g. Islam and Christianity. Would that work? I think in ex-pat schools it may but in some local private schools; I doubt it. However; if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion; it could work......	1

"I can't think of a good argument against learning the language of one's host nation (provided; as Isobel said; that a student can handle the academic rigors of such a class). Sharia? I'd personally have a problem with that being mandatory. Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion; it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class; say; for high school students. Then it would be appropriate. If instead of Sharia; you meant they should be teaching all children Islamiyat/Islamic Studies classes; then you'd get a vehement NO from me. Unless you're going to couch it in a ""comparative religion"" class that EVERYONE has to take; then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I don't subscribe to? I would be more than happy for my child to take a class on ""history of the Middle East and the Islamic World"" or ""Arab cultural studies"" (and much like an A....."	1

GCC countries normally had 5 years validation of drivers license; but in any case you change your employer; it should be re-validated under the new sponsor.

 anybody can advise me a trick to get driving licence on parking test? thanks	First prepare yourself and ignore the police when he shout so you don't feel nervous. Make sure you don't knock over any pole. Begin Reverse 2 inches away from the pole in your right hand side. When you don't see the first corner of the pole of the parking box covers by the part of the car; take a full turn to the right. Adjust your mirror on the left hand side down to see the white line; then reverse slowly. When you see the white line in the middle of the left back wheel; take a full turn to the left then move slowly then you will be inside the pocket parking. I hope it helps!!!

I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

Mr.Calculator consumes major space for the same answer which is not helping the person with right answer?!; you can not drive a car with Egypitian licence here; as a visitor first 10 days you can drive but later you need to take a temporary driving licence for 3 months. you have to pay 100 riyal for every month and need to take eye-test for this licence.	1
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	"I totally disagree with ""Sun Fun Sea"" all the major accidents are not caused by Indians; may be Indians invloved in this accident because of the other party (most of them are locals with crazy driving) and you can see majority in Qatar are Indians that is why you can see more Indians involved in accidents; but not all their faults; and all Indians are not riding bicycles in their past that is because of your lack of knowledge about India. What was the vehicle you used in your country before invent cars? be logic and dont generalize people with your lack of general knowledge."	0

I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.	1

I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days.

Hello QatarLiving! My family and I will be away for vacation. PLEASE tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you’re out of town!! I don’t know where to take him and I don’t trust anyone to do that for me :-(	"dogs in Islam are acceptable so long as they serve a ""purpose"". In my own home; they provide security. There are steps to take in the Muslim faith so that dogs are allowed (concerns washing dishes; the person if touched; etc.) My main concern is that this has been allowed to be interpreted as dogs are ""haram"" - and some people take this as a reason to be cruel and abusive. One (western) person I know said that this was due to ""Arab cruelty"" (his words; not mine); I in turn replied ""I feel sorry for those who think lke that (and you) because some people (and not just those of the Muslim faith) do not know how much security and real affection dogs can give - they are always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotions. All they ask is sufficient food; water; to be treated without pain or hurt; and a few kind words."""	0

( the paper and where to send it ) many thanks.	you will need to send the pet relocator a copy of your Passport and the dogs latest Vaccination record with the Rabies vaccine older the one month and not more than one year old. The dogs need to be older than 4months; which I am assuming they are:-)	1

The health certificate needs to be within one week but the vaccine has to be given at least 30 days before travel. It's not recommended to breed and sell puppies here - there are far too many irresponsible people who get bored and abandon them. Come down to the rescue shelter when you get here and you'll see the number of pure-bred dogs that were abandoned because they got too big; or too energetic; or because their owner was going on vacation!	1

i want someone to share my life with... but i want labrador retriever.. is there any chance i can find here in qatar?	He's going to his new home this weekend. Why do you want a labrador? Have you had experience with this breed before? Labradors are far from easy to keep and need a huge amount of exercise so they don't get destructive. Have you had dogs before? Where will it live? Have you thought about what you will do when you go on vacation? Or leave Qatar for good? Have you looked into all the costs involved with having a dog - from adoption fees; vaccinations; food; boarding kennels etc.	0

Have you smell the BALUT??? Try it first! Your term Kick her??? mmm... such ridiculous man. How handsome are you by the way? and by the way; does your girl friend knows that you post your BALUT issue here? If she know am sure she will kick you out first before you act.	0

i am a chinese girl now working in shanghai for an American website:www.smarter.com i just graduated from university majoring in english;working in different country is my dream;can someone give me advice what job i can do in Doha;and is it hard to live in the city? are there some good websites for applying a job in Doha? thank you for your time!!	I would advise you to pick a different place. Many people will view you as nothing but a prostitute in Qatar. Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month. Plus they aren't going to pay you what you're worth because you are Chinese. Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here. Not fair; I know. If you do go...don't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom. I hope this helps. Sage	1

Thank you for your advice;it is really helpful;Also;i have a different thinking about the city now;but if i have chance i still will go there. the reason why i go there is not for money;and i can have a good life in China;and i only want to work one year there;i just want to enrich my life;know more about the world;like now;i know their attitude about chinese girls;hooker;i think there must be some Chinese people do it there; but not all!what others look at me is not important;the point is that i know what i am doing. i know that is a rich place because of oil; but only rich material life;shanghai people is not that rich; but i really suggest they can visit here; they will know how wonderful this city is; how great the people is and how happy the life is.money is not everything; it is only one tool for us to reach happiness;and i am happy now. people there can look down upon Chinese people;it doesn't matter;cause we are so proud of ourselves.	0

Honestly; if you want to enrich your life then Qatar is the worst place I can think of; honestly. Qatar is the definition of an empty shell. Nothing of substance here whatsoever. Here you have an entire displaced foreign population - all here for working only! There is no culture here. Work is the culture. As for the geography...the worst found anywhere in the world. No trees; no rivers; no lakes; no mountains; lots of traffic though; terrible climate; etc. etc. Combine that with no fun at all; unfair pay based on your nationality; and the surrender of your passport. If that is your idea of enriching your life... go for it!	1

Lots of jobs.... Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality. Qatar taxes income by housing rent (50% mininum) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent (even if it increases). You will need QR 1000 for food & other expenses if single. Anything above that you can save; depending on how much you want to save. I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent; else you would be really wasting your time and youth. Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries.(SriLankans & Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low.) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction. 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into. The second is not a boom its a BLAST. Theres always jobs in Construction Companies. All other services are growing.....	1

This is a complicated society but it can be very enriching. Try spending a weekend in the desert with a Qatari family; attending a Magilist; learning Arabic; learning to dive; going fishing and sailing with Qataris. I have done all of these things. It is not easy to make the connections; you have to make the effort but like many other things in life; the more effort you make; the better the rewards. I think you do most things here that you can do anywhere else. I admit; I miss mountains and climbing and greenery but there are plenty of good things here and some very fine people. Just go and out and find them.	1

"Undoubtedly you can experience new things and enrich yourself in Qatar; as in any other country for that matter; but the question here is another in my opinion. We cannot pretend there are not issues in this place; specially if you carry the ""wrong"" passport; so I think it is fair that Maggie gets the full picture; both the rosy and the dark side of Qatar. Then she can make up her mind."	1

Then logically; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows. I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity. Further; the 'anti-matter' and 'negetive energies' are still theoretical concepts. If the same are proven someday; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all. But; at present; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes; neutron stars or white dwarfs.	1

Allegedly from Dr John Smith of the athiest society. http://www.qatarliving.com/files/image001_23.jpg	At one point in their history Sikhs were either hindus or muslims There religious teaCHER declared himself as a prophet of sorts and Now an interesting fact Adi gRanth takes most of its principles from the Quran; so its no biggy that it mentions the Big bang and the round earth(though in the Quran the shape is of a sphere which is more correct) etc. The book was compiled by studying the faith of islam with two of his muslim friends namely Sheikh Farid; and Kabir. He never claimed divinity though but installed the principle of One God (Same as Islam) and the priesthood (Not important in Islam atall).	1

Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure(Nurse) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required? Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it. Since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply. Hope this helps	1

You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year & then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates & work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...	1

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.	1

Thanks ecabs..so u mean i can take NHA Exam without the necessary work experience? the validity is 2yrs so it wont be a problem as long as i pass it..getting the NHA license can come later; what i really wanted to know was if I can take the exam or not..anyway it was a lot help thank u..	0

"Considering nationality; income etc is a smart thing to do IMHO. Nationality differences can lead to disputes about where you will live; if it is accepted to the family; if you will be able to get your spouse into your country and many more. As for financial status; love is great but it doesnt pay the bills. I for one wouldnt want to have a future with someone if we didnt have a pot to p*ss in or a window to throw it out my entire life; but I guess thats just my female gold digging instinct. I love the fact that someone stated that we girls/ladies are the only ones who see their potential partner as an investment. _____________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""	1
Just heard from QBS radio... so now i wonder what love really is?

It is a contract...love is GIVING without expecting anything in return..

Batman; a provisional driving licence-holder; was found to be over the drink-drive limit. Superman; who held a full driving licence; was also breath-tested and found to be the same. Both men have now been charged. The pair were among 15 people who were arrested in Fife as part of a clampdown on drink driving. Fife Police said the pair of superheroes were stopped near Anstruther in the early hours of Sunday morning. The two men; both in their early 20s; were on their way home from a fancy-dress party when they were ordered to pull over. A source at Fife Police said: ""This is a real fall from grace for two superheroes. I am sure drink driving is not allowed in Gotham City; and it is certainly not to allow....."	0

I really need to buy massive amount of silica gel. Can anyone advise me please where I can buy these? Cheers	"I think no one will sale a large amount for that; if you really need it; you should have taken a permit first from ministry of Health or elsewhere. Silica is if i am correct is derived from the element or a substance like acid or solvent and in that case; any large amount is questionable by authority; because; some might be used for making something destructive; if you know what i mean; or something use by sniffers??? I am not really sure of what i said; but; one thing is sure; if you need it in big quantity; you should have taken a permission from authority..   "" There's nothing we can do to change the past; if it teaches  you a lesson profit from it then; forget it."""	0

I don't know if Filipinos eat dog meat but I heard that the Vietnamese and Koreans do. Infact it is said to be an expensive dish.

This question is a just a diversive way of saying that Filipinos do eat dog meat. Come on; look around and be good to people. asking a question that you know the answer is 5tup1d1ty.

A friend of mine lost his dog; when he searched for it other said it has gone to stomach of neighbor filipino.; so I began enquiring about it and an filipino engineer told me the dog meat is extra special meal for our wedding ceremonies.; Still i am doubting about? is there any true in it?	"Vma; in Nagaland(India); they feed the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer. Then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it becomes sick and throw up. They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts. And BTW; they eat dogs;crows;rats etc in some parts of the north east too. So ""dog meat curry"" and ""dog puke"" is an Indian dish. I have heard that other Asians like a some Koreans(not all) and some Japanese eat ""dog meat"" too. Exotic food is popular in many Asian country. But Filipinos do it ""field rats"" and ""snake meat""; if I am not wrong!"	0

"I am INDIAN; and agree with Carlester ... it was a indirect question ""Does Philipinos eat dot meat"".. there are lots of stories going around the way Filipinos eat. Can someone put some light...which are the meat popular in Philipines..( apart from chicken; mutton; beef; pork ) it may clear lots of doubts ( including mine ! )"	0

I think you are getting confused with Pig. Pig is served on Philipino weddings. Dogs are not eaten by Filipinos as far as I know. Curry is an Indian dish not a flilipino dish..	1

Dear fellow QL's; I am planning to buy a car but so far have been intimidated with the escalating car prices in almost all dealerships and agencies. I am now revising my plans to wait for promotion or season where the price is discounted. Can anyone help me when will be the best time to buy a Car? Further clarifications would be; would it be best to buy during Ramadan; last quarter of the year; etc.... Thanks in advance.	The Best time to buy is................... when u hv lots of money in ur pocket.....	0

Selection is narrowed by availability of certain models; colors; etc. But sometimes you can get quite a good deal..	1

You will get good resale for any Toyota. And an older Camry is nothing to worry about; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You'll probably die long before your Camry does haha	1

My budget is arrount 45K And what I found in market is either : Camry 2009 or Corolla 2012 So what do you think ? Thank you	just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy; has a full service record and stay away from cars with unknown histories..a car is only as good as its maintenance and even a Camry/Corolla has to depend on its owner to take care of it. You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr. they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car.. Best of luck	0

I'm looking to by a new car; but the local GM dealer is useless and looked at me like I'd asked for a turbocharged donkey when I said I wanted a manual gearbox. So; I've seen the car I want in Dubai. Is it possible for me to get a loan here; buy the car from Dubai; import and then register it here; or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country? Thanks	take a personal loan for the amount needed for the car... You can then have the money paid to your account and you can do with it what you like:-)	1

Sooooooo; it is possible to take a personal loan and get the car. Might have to investigate this a bit further :) Saeedkan; you'll have to show me this trick of eating the wrong way.

Thanks	Hi Alan; you might wanna re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4% as compared to approx 9% for a personal loan. If you check with manager (not sales guy) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you. I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too. Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead. With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go (just my oponion)	1

Is it possible for me to get a loan here; buy the car from Dubai; import and then register it here; or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country? Thanks	Mandilulur; ignore the profile; its nonsense. I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum. My name isn't Alan either; but it'll do for this forum :) B2D; driving is always fun; I love cars; always have. Plus its an adventure; never done it before :) Cy; I know about the rates; but the actual monthly payment costs aren't too different; yes I pay more overall; but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want. I'm a Brit; I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear. I bought the car; I'll decide when to change. Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show; and they still aren't as good as a manual box. The wannabe Schumacher's of this world can have them; I'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks. Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox; not a sodding computer. :)	0

I also drive a manual and when I went to buy it and insisted on it; the salesman was surprised that I would ask for manual over auto... Besides what you have said regarding manuals... they are also easier to push start should the need arise;-P	0

Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	Thank you very much for information can anyone have idea how much tiution fees compare to Bright Future Pakistani school in PEC? (Private) school or Govt! Thanks	0
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	Frankly speaking; all pakistani schools suck . as none of them have any standard if we compare them to the Indian schools. However; out of the available one; Bright future is the best. DO not go for a lower fee paksitnai school as PEC would be the lowest. If you can afford; get your children in private school like Cambridge etc or otherwise Bright Future is the best.	1
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	There are three Pakistani schools here in Qatar.. PEC; Pakshama and Bright Future and to be honest; they all suck big time. I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it wasn't so bad that time. We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good. But then somewhere end of the 80's or beginning of 90's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months. I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly. They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation. In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened. I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two. I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good.. MES Ideal Indian School Shantinekatan DMIS DPS By the .....	1
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	My eldest son is at Bright Future Pakistani. Honestly; I am not satisfied with the school. They dont have good standard. My son is having problem with his study there. Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also. They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids. lack of creativity. Too much URDU Lesson (which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework). If you lucky; your child will be teached by skilled teacher (my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school). Unfortunately this year for grade 1; he's stuck with unskilled teacher :( Indian school? yes they are good; but very difficult to get space. We've been trying for a year now. NO LUCK !! Other international Schools? They suck our blood out ! One thing good is that we can afford the fee of BFS. (My husband is a Pakistani but I am not)	0
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar?

Some people are giving wrong informations about tourist visa; they cant stop tourist visa as they are promoting tourisum these days; you can bring your relatives only by tourist visa for 14 day and can be extended for another 14 days; after 28 days you need to exit from Qatar to any nearest Airport and can come back again with another tourist visa; this is allowded only 2 exit mean 28+28+28 maximum approx. three months 54 days only not for 6 months as some one says.	1

It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??	In general the higher the price the newer and better the house/apartment. However note that some new houses have high rents ('cause they're new and big) but are located in crap areas! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR; and many of those places already have waiting lists. Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries. There's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates; it's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere. If your employer won't take care of it; best is to come here and take a look by yourself... Good luck.	1
It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??	Luciano From my experience the cheaper places (7-8k a month) have lower quality than the more expensive places (18k for a 2 bedroom). However; do not expect to see excellent quality on the expensive places either because you won't.	0

It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??	Accommodations of higher rent like 15k to 25k per month will be in better quality than the cheaper ones. It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent. I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities. There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities.	1

Why is milk so much more expensive in Qatar than anywhere else? PS This thread is dedicated to Lincoln Pirate ;-)	Some people say because it is imported.

"our kids were there last year; but we have transferred them to a cheaper and better school. Can't say where as 'someone' will work out who i am. Kids did ok; but were not at all challenged. Biggest issue is the student mix and the site. It's too small now (around 200 kids I understand); so they have lunch in the classroom and take turns at playing outside. Quality of ed. is basic. Owing to language difficulties; (loads of Dutch and Danes) it's lowest common denominator stuff. But if your kids are bright; even the schools that are 'closed' will interview and test. Ours are now going to one that has been full for 4 years; but we didn't have to wait as they did v well on the entrance exam. Hamdulillah. And the fees? As said above; ""because they can""..."	1

I have a tough job. It's that of being busy without having much business ;) I try different techniques like never walking across the office floor without a paper in hand. Walking fast looking at my watch. Never giving an appointment straight away and without saying ""hmmm lemme look at my calendar please"". What measures do you guys take? And what do you do apart from Qling to give an impression of being immensely busy?"	I always keep a speadsheet open on my laptop even if it's only the cleaners coming to clean my room...lol ;) Source: - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I (September;1999)	1

Show them you are not tnat kind and better for them to be very careful with you.	1

A yearly salary increase would also be a benefit.	1

Ask for 13;000 housing and also a list of schools they will pay for when your child becomes school age (or allowance of 45;000 for schools if you agree to stay that long). And ensure it is a negotiable contract year so you have time to review after you have lived here for a while? Congratulations!	1

I did not like the offer and asked to revise basic salary from 19k to 25 000 QAR. What do you think?	for starters; it is a good package and i believe you should take up the offer. You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios	1

Hey; can anyone please tell me whether a colour blind engineer is acceptable to QP??	it depends upon the position; for ex; i know for a fact that a candidate was rejected becasue he couldnt spot a shade of green properly; he wasnt colour blind; there was a lot of defence for his case; but he was rejected because he couldnt recognise a shade of green. here it probably mattered becasue he would be working in the lab. so it really depends upon the field of activity.

Hey; can anyone please tell me whether a colour blind engineer is acceptable to QP??	looks like you are refering to a lady engineer; if her work isnt field related; then theres a good possibility of her getting through; moreover if she is really good and the department encourages her case; a lot can happen. because in such cases; if the candidate is really deserving the HR may forward the case to the concerend department to reach a final decision.if the dept insists on having her and that her problem wont interfere with work; then anything is possible. all in its good time. happy heart DRIVE SAFE;someone is waiting for you at home	0

I feel a little foolish asking this. I'm moving to Qatar in a month for a new job. I've never been to Qatar before. Recently a colleague who's worked in Qatar told me that single guys aren't allowed in to malls & other places on weekends.(unless they're accompanied by women or a family) Is this true? If true; do these restrictions extend to coffee shops; supermarkets; movies & other places. Also if true; why on earth is there such a rule?	it's not bad as what you think?	0

I'll be joining Al Jazeera International ; a dream I've had for some time now. I need to ask anyone; employees of Al Jazeera or anyone working in Qatar; what kind of accommodation is provided by Al Jazeera for singles. Im worried that pre-determined accommodation may be unsuitable or in an unsafe neighbourhood. Can anyone help me out on this? Id really appreciate it. Thanks	I don't think you have anything to worry about. We know a couple of Al Jazeera Int'l employees and they were given really great spacious furnished apartments (I think they were 3bdrm). And then those that had family accommodations were given villas in a great compound.	1

Thanks	Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best	0

Thanks	aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.	1

I knowlingly bought two boxes of Special K sustain for 47.50QAR each. I am so ashamed of myself. What is the worst sin you have done in Qatar...?????	You often find that when Megamart get something new in they slap a ridiculously high price on it in the hope that people will just buy it (which we often do; clearly). But I've quite often seen that a few weeks later the price is drastically reduced; sometimes halved; presumably because not enough people were buying it at the ridiculous price.	1

I normally boil the water that comes in big CANs + bottles..I dont use it directly for my 7month old baby..The brands like MASAFI; RAYYAN; MANHAL are safe; as far as i have used it for my baby since her birth..But yes; as a precautionery measure; i do boil before adding SIMILAC powder..	1

It's a bit more expensive than other water but it's worth it and you find it in all Carrefours. You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately...if you decide to go for another brand; make sure Sodium content is less than 20. We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian. My 5 year old was also on it when she was little. Also; what formula are you using? they are not always identical to UK ones. I tried Nestle's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now. I don't know if it's your first baby but in case it is - don't worry to much about what is so called ""recommended milk intake is"" - both my daughters always took at least 30% less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal. Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice."	1

Maybe your grandson still adjusting with the situation and the weather here. Because it happened also to my baby when we were travelling. She didn`t drink her milk like before; but after few days everything is back to normal. And for the water i recommend Nestle; or Masafi. Good luck	1
