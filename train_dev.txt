i am currently working here in dubai and i got an offer from qatar company.. they offered 8000QAR +camp accommodation +meal and transportation is provided by the company... will this be enough to accept the offer? how good is the transportation there in qatar?	depends on where the accommodation is.. how many people will live with you; what kind of food. Why dont u ask your company to provide you transportation and ask for 4k more as accommodation and food allowance. Most importantly; 8k isnt a great salary but it all again depends on your job profile and work experience.	1
i am currently working here in dubai and i got an offer from qatar company.. they offered 8000QAR +camp accommodation +meal and transportation is provided by the company... will this be enough to accept the offer? how good is the transportation there in qatar?	If the company is from Oil and Gas Industry or working for that Industry; then their accommodation and transport will be better. If it is normal construction company; they dont have good facilities. As far as your question of salary is concerned; you dont need to ask; as Dubai is not so different from Qatar and the currency is also the same.	1

The camp at NDIA is not too bad. Cabins are only a few years old and there are plenty facilities. Transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minutes driving max. Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal! If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here.	1

What can I possibly say about the Fetish Barbie scheduled to spank uh; hit store shelves this autumn? Only that its about time. And I have to have one.

Discussing with my company regarding annual increment of allowance. Is there any official statistics about increment of prices in Qatar? Something official statistics agency; Central Bank of Qatar or similar?	there has been much press lately about the drop in prices; food; and especially housing prices have been decreasing. So if you bring up a need for an increase in your allowances and salary right now; you probably won't get very far; maybe even have allowances decreased! There is something called the Qatar Statistics Authority at http://www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm May be helpful; but not sure. The English spelling in their reports is atrocious; they even spell literacy wrong! Makes me wonder about errors in their methodologies and data collection if they can't get even that right.	1
Discussing with my company regarding annual increment of allowance. Is there any official statistics about increment of prices in Qatar? Something official statistics agency; Central Bank of Qatar or similar?	well; discussion has to be based in something with an official "smell".

Lets talk next year :) War looking for peace; is like fornication looking for virginity.	1

I am selling one month old car; 1600 KM; GMC Yukon Danali; FULL options; white The price of the car is around 230;000 NEW. This is 2012 model. How much do you think it will be sold from new price? Car is excellent; of course brand new; even the plastic seat covers are on it.	20% to 30% value of the car will go down to attract the people otherwise they will go with the brand new car it's only my idea .	1

Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	If you have time and you're a patient person; please go for HSBC. It takes in average 30 minutes to reach someone when you call the customer service! And if you call after 5 PM; after waiting 30 minutes they will ask you to call the day after. Another one from HSBC; if you travel abroad; they may eventually block your credit card (for security reason) and will inform you only when you are back in Qatar.

I have been looking for months for a judo club. There's a federation here but when i contacted them they couldnt really tell me where i could find a club for my son. It seems that judo is taught here in schools but only for qataris! There must be a club somewhere in Doha that accepts non qataris. Does anyone know of a judo club; my son is 5 years old. thanks	There are few martial arts centres here in Doha.

There is no private JUDO clubs except the federations without proper motivations for their players. The closes thing that I saw is the one near to Frinje Naseer area. It is Jujitsu Club. As you know Jujitsu is the first cousin of JUDO. I think I will enroll there; cause I am become rusty as days passby. They are open in the evening.	1

I teach judo at a school; and no; your child is too small for my club because five years old is the bare minimum to start judo; otherwise; the judo club becomes a day care. I would start with the Qatari Judo Federation. They seem to be pretty good with the kids. I haven't worked out with the adult players; because they are always training elsewhere. But the few times I've gone to visit them; there were kids working out. Tunisians are the instructors; and if your game to learn (or already know) French; I would enroll them in their program. They seem very qualified. It's an Arabic/French class at one of the local sports clubs around the Dafna area. Let me know; and I can try to get you contacted with the right people.	1

Hi all; I am seriously considering moving to Qatar. I've just finished my PhD in civil engineering (Geotechnics); I have only 1 year experience. I am German. How much should I expect in Qatar now?

Do i leave paintings of living things (even animals?) at home? What can I expect?	mmmm... I think yes; you cannot have pictures of animals; except the birds in the qatari notes; the orix that is everywhere (for instance in the logo of Qatar Airways); the falcon pictures... War looking for peace; is like fornication looking for virginity.	1

I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver; have heard some agencies here in DOha do it...any tips?? Many thanks	My experience with Eurodollar: I asked them about what happens if there is a minor scratch. They say that there are sometimes charges of 20/30 QR. A few weeks later; the car needed to come into service. The car had small scratch on front bumper. They make a big deal of it even though I am pretty sure it was there before I hired it. After service; they did not mention it and I took it out for another month. Next day they phoned me saying it would need to be charged at 450 QR! I tell them that they are taking the piss and ask to speak to the manager. A man phones later and insists I pay it claiming I need things like police reports etc - when I refuse he tells me to return the car. I say no problem if you give me back my money for the month I have hired the car. I suggest he comes into work and picks up the car. He does not come in and does not phone again. Next day; car has a problem and won't start (it has lots of little problems due to poor servicing). They come out with new key but take much longer than they said they would. The same guy finally turns up with another who looks threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch. I tell them my feelings that it is minor but he makes a big deal about needing to get the whole bumper re-sprayed and that anybody doing the job for 100 QR (as I thought reasonable) would not do a good job. He says that as I am such a pal he will reduce it to 350 QR and that he will pay the remaining 100 QR. Basically; I have to agree to pay or there will be no new key. I take the car to the main dealers and they quote 100 QR!!!! I believe that it is not likely that the main dealers for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it comes to spraying. I suggest you avoid Eurodollar as they are trying to squeeze money out of any opportunity... Even worse than the other car hire places I have tried.	1

I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha	The Anglican church of Doha is where most "english'speaking people go to in doha. Their church building is still under construction in the Abu Hamour church complex.But their services take place in Doha English speaking school(DESK)near Markhiya round about. Entry to the place is restricted and Qatar police will be gaurding the gate always. so if you want to go you have to call the pastor and inform him so they will add your name to the list with the police. If you need the phone number just write back.	1
I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha	There are no Baptist churches as such in Doha. Only a handful of Christian communities are allowed to have recognized; sponsored; full-time clergy; and the Baptists are not one of them. The Emir graciously granted land to the Anglican church to lead the various independent Protestant Christian communities in Doha to contract a Protestant center. Most Baptists and evangelical Christians I know tend to go to the non-denominational Christian communities such as Doha Fellowship and Grace Fellowship. Both have webpages. Like the Anglican church (and much of Qatar for the that matter) services are conducted in English; but a fair number of participants do not speak English as their first language. Hope you find what you are looking for.	1

However; you need to book in December to get a place. Doha Vets have just opened a new facility; call them on 4367187; they may be able to help you; the price will be less if you can find someone who is prepared to share the cage with their cat (if and only if they get along well). Also check with QAWS; they may have space but you really will be very lucky to pay less than the going rate; competition for cages is strong at this time of year. There is a lady who will visit your house daily; change the litter and feed but it is very sad to leave a lone cat for a month; if you consider doing this why not offer a home to one of QAWS many cats looking for a home? Then; you can leave the cat knowing he will be happy and also giving a home to a cat who really needs it. jj	1

We're a rescue shelter only. If you're looking for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you are away you will need to spend more then that. 2 months boarding in any of the catteries here in Qatar would be a minimum of QR2;400. And it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him.	1

Is the TV signal in Qatar Digital? Is a digital set top box required. If so will a UK set top box work? I have a spare one in the UK and wondered if it was worth bringing to Qatar with me. Regards	As far as I know there is no terrestrial broadcast in Qatar; everyone uses satellite pointed at Arab Sat and Nile Sat etc. So a digital terrestrial receiver attached to an aerial will not work. You can by a cheap satellite decoder from supermarkets etc to receive free channels; otherwise you need to subscribe with QTel for a package; like OSN etc. Find details on QTel website.	1

. What would you do if you find out that the gift that you have given to someone was put on sale at the classified with a label "unwanted gift"? .	... I would be hurt if I was you. I have been given the most strangest things when I left work in Abu Dhabi; before coming here. I have kept them; shipped them here to Qatar AND they are a mismatch on my shelves. But you know what? They make this place unique and special; because each thing brings back a memory of a special time AND person. I would NEVER gift something that has been given to me as I do not have the guts or morals to do that.

Sonaam; you could then give it back to Malrat who could then give it again to the ungateful and original recipient; it could then go round in a circle until we all get dizzy.

Hi there; Does any of you know what are the criteria/requirements for a women to sponsor her husband in Doha? There is a minimum salary; it is possible; etc.? Thanks!	TB; you always amaze me with your confident yet ignorant answers; especially when it comes to the immigration issues. Of course ladies are allowed to sponsor their husbands. At least there is no a legal limitation on it. Yes; it's is much more difficult; than husband sponsoring his wife.. but it IS possible. It depends on few factors; and each application is considered by the authorities on case-to-case basis.	1

Depends on the nationality of the subject. There are some nationalities which are "frowned upon" by the Qatari government (due to political reasons). Jordanians; Iraqis; Palestinians (from abroad) and indians too as they always try to regulate the ratios of nationalities in the country.	1

Cumbersome this rule was actually passed just a couple of days ago so it seems. I'm talking about visit visa being stopped completely for everyone; not any specific nationality.

What about Chevrolet Aveo cars in Qatar Market. is it expencive or not in maintanance?

At October - November in Doha; there will be transition from summer to winter. There will be a lot of Thunder / Lightning / Flash. How to Calculate The Distance between us to The Thunder Light ?	<img src="http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/lighthun.gif" width=350 height=180 /> <b>Explanation:</b> Calculate how many seconds when you saw the flash of lightning; until you hear thunder then divide the value by 3 to know the distance in Kilometers or divide by 5 to know the distances in Miles <b>Example: </b> You see flashes of lightning; 12 seconds later; his voice booming. So the distance of lightning by yourself is 12 / 3 = 4 km (approximately ) When the flash light; at that time we also see it immediately; because the speed of light is very high; 299;792;458 meters per second. There's almost no delay to reach our eyes. But; the speed of sound "only" 331 meters per second. As a result; some time after the lightning lit; the new voice boomed. Therefore; the distance of lightning with thunder listeners about a mile every three seconds. Thunder is rarely heard at a distance of more than 25 kilometers. <img src="http://u.kaskus.us/3/mfibgiyr.gif" width=250 height=150 /> Good Article... by Aikon	1

Hi everybody;Somebody hit my car ; the back side bumper is damaged; So I told police and they asked to come later. Will insurance pay my loss? I have a third party insurance. Thanks in advance!	If you the culprit you can get from his insurance if not then you have to cough up the cost yourself..	1
Hi everybody;Somebody hit my car ; the back side bumper is damaged; So I told police and they asked to come later. Will insurance pay my loss? I have a third party insurance. Thanks in advance!	If you dont know who hits you; then you are responsible to go to police dept. to make a report for the damage and you'll pay 110. They will check also if you have any violation (if you have; sadly you have to pay it or else you're not gonna get the report). Since its only TPL; sadly (again) you will bear the expenses for the repair.	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	Cheerios is a cereal name brand. I'd check Mega Mart. There are many western products in stock there. Prepare to pay out the wazoo for them though!	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	I saw them on sunday in Megamart	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	There was also some at Shoprite. Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	The Honey Nut Cheerios almost always seem to be in stock at MegaMart - at least when I go. The regular Cheerios are more difficult to find; but they do exist. (Buy them up when you can find them!) Keep in mind that the Honey Nut Cheerios have a lot of sugar (9g per serving) compared to the regular Cheerios (1g per serving) http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20081001/kids-cereals-some-are-50-percent-sugar They're not as bad as some other cereals that target kids; but they're still quite sweet.	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	thank you all for the inputs... i hope i'll get to find those regular cheerios	0
can you find cheerios in Doha???	So funny that you asked because I've been looking for them for a while too. Here's my info: 1. Regular; plain cheerios: I've only found them at Megamart. And they cost like 23 riyals for a very small box! 2. Honey Cheerios (from Nestle): These are available at just about every grocery store like Family Food Centre; Food Palace; Lulu; Carrefour. They only cost around 13 riyals for a box. Hope this helps.	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	I was going to write the same thing as NY couple. In Family food centre you can occassionally get vanilla cheerios which do well on the taste buds but are a bit on the expensive side - like 35 riyals.	1
can you find cheerios in Doha???	Oh and don't buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereals advertised. They're all still pretty heavily processed. Best healthiest thing to do for breakfast is eat as much protein as you can - hence eggs are highly recommended.	0
can you find cheerios in Doha???	Cheerios are processed - absolutely. However; on an overall basis they're much healthier than most of the other garbage out there that is marketed to mums for their babies & toddlers. The sugar content of plain ol' Cheerios is also far lower than that of sugared cereals and other snacks; which are generally even more processed than Cheerios. Some of the sugared cereals are up to 50% sugar (by weight - and more than that as a % of calories). Even some of the yogurts have more grams of sugar per serving than a full-sized can of Coke; thanks to all the added sugar (and high fructose corn syrup). Plain unsweetened/unflavored yogurt does contain natural sugar; as does fruit; but nowhere near the sugar levels of the typical "fruit" yogurt here in Qatar. Nothing is ever truly perfect in the snack food world; but we can strive for "the best we can find". . .I just try to read the labels and use common sense :o)	0
can you find cheerios in Doha???	Don't get me wrong doody. I myself have honey cheerios at home which I on occasion eat cause they're quite tasty. What I meant to say; though it didn't come across properly; was that the advertising campaign that Nestle cheerios has is over exaggerated. Companies like nestle tend to amplify what little nutritional value their products have to convince consumers to buy them. Like expat sueno says; they are a bit healthier than the other stuff out there but at the same time they're still not that healthy. Anyway I don't mean to be a diet Nazi; you should eat what you wish :) Oh and I have to agree with Doratheexplorer; I'm not sure about giving cheerios to a baby you'd have to check up on that.	0

Please help me to give right answers.. Thanks and Best regards	The only problem you will have is you can't get your final exit from Qatar until you get an NOC from the bank to say that you have paid back your loans. If you can't get a new job you might have to borrow money from family back home to pay back the loans here; otherwise things can get difficult.	1

Please help me to give right answers.. Thanks and Best regards	"you change sponsorship you still have to pay car loan?" A loan is a loan no matter what and it has to be repaid in full. Now if it's a company loan for car then for sure they'll take it from your end of service payment (or as much as they can). If it's a bank loan then notify the bank immediately that you have been terminated and let them know you are actively searching for a new job in order to be able to repay the debt. Best of luck!!	1

Please help me to give right answers.. Thanks and Best regards	Nothing fatal! Find another job and keep paying your loan; what's the problem? Loan and credit cards have nothing to do with your sponsorship. Unless your company cancelled your RP... then your current company must inform your bank; and they will simply freeze your account until you find another job. Nothing extraordinary. If you want to leave for good; you will have to pay off your loan. Then sell your car and close the outstanding balance; that's it.	1

"Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Furniture price wise; which one is offerring lower price? And quality wise which is better?	<b>HOME CENTER</b> Quality very good but prices are quit high . Sorry; don't know about HOMES R US	1
"Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Furniture price wise; which one is offerring lower price? And quality wise which is better?	wanna cheap; go to Najma. Then you have to arrange the transport; which avaliable arround you there. I'm not talking about quality over there.	1
"Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Furniture price wise; which one is offerring lower price? And quality wise which is better?	Both are the same standard. Decent Quality and decent prices (on sale). Try out this new furniture shop in this new mall come up adjacent to la cigale hotel - al saad.This mall has benetton; BHS etc. On the first level is this furniture shop - it had great looking furniture (The one; id design standard but with home center prices). I have already furnished my place but this is one recommended buy. Doesn't have too much of choice though but since it is a one off shop there are high chances of you do end up having the same furniture as your neighbour (which is a high probabiliy with home center/homes r us)	1
"Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Furniture price wise; which one is offerring lower price? And quality wise which is better?	I think they both are having the same quality ... mostly Chinese or Veitnamees ... it depnd on the materials .. if it is solid wood or rubber wood then it is diffirent from MDF and so on ... now u have a chance to buy from Home cemter because they have special offer ... buy 250 and get 50 . according to ur budget u will be able to move . I personally prefer home center which I furnished my house here and back home from it . they have more branches and more options to chose . good luck	1

hey guys; anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy?	I see. You're in a different situation. You don't need an affidavit of support since your cousin will be on a business visa. What you need is an assurance letter from the company or person that granted the visa regarding the stay of your cousin here in Doha.	1

hey guys; anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy?	@lizkat. Family visit visa is only applicable to immediate family members such as husband; children; parents and siblings. Your cousin is not your immediate relative. So you cannot apply for a family visit visa for her/him.	1
hey guys; anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy?	so it means that even if my sister will have the same business visa they will still refuse to give me an affidavit of support. thats so sad. i just wanted them to be with me for a week or two so we could be together.	0

When the guy is asking a simple question answer with relevance. No pal Tata Sky does not work so well during the day due to Solar Disturbance. Dont listen to the QTEL's self proclaimed spokesmen who speak only crap. Nothing will happen if you use Tata Sky. I dont find it illegal at all since it does not air porn channels but pure family entertainment. Secondly its been registered and paid for services. There should be no harm using it as long as you dont bother QTEL. QTEL should not be bothered as they provide useless TV channels in Doha; unlike in Dubai PEHLA Network is facing losses due to customer switchover. If it is illegal; then please talk with facts where in Qatar QTEL pulled out the dish antennas for Tata SKY. No one cares. Dream Box is still flooded in the market and that should be something QTEL should ban as its a portal for obscene channels..	1

Hi Guys... Till today morning my application status was showing as under process on the MOI website for family visa. Now I checked at 1 pm and it still shows under process but in a different way and also shows expiry date; application date etc...but the visa number is not there! Does this mean I have to go to immigration to pay the fees?	Hi Dear; Wishing you Happy New Year 2012. Yes you have been allotted with Visa but its still undergoing few formalities like Final Signature from Signing Authority and Security Clearance. You should go to immigration department and show them the application receipt. They will let you know the exact status. Once everything is done...the status will be changed to "Ready for Printing" and later you can get it printed either from MOI website or get the printed copy from Immigration Dept. Hope this answers your question. All The Best.	1

Hello. We just realized that our lifetime CDs of photos and weddings were missing. It was 2 months ago after our boxes were land freight to Doha from Dubai.

Would love to hear from you and your comments. Thanks	That's terrible. How do you know that they were confiscated?	0

Would love to hear from you and your comments. Thanks	Thanks for the comments. I am hoping that someone can give me some advice how and where to claim this item back. This is the first time we ever ship through land freight. We always used air cargo in the past and our CDs went through just fine. They questioned us; but never confiscate. The guy who we dealt with never informed us verbally nor in in writing about restrictions. The drivers didn't care whether our things were confiscated. Anyway; it's not that important to blame anyone. I just want to get my CDs back. Most of our boxes were torn apart. We lost all of our medicines even children vitamins and other things. However; we didn't mind as these can be replaced. Our lifetime photos cannot unfortunately.	0

Could anyone please advise me; I have just been offered a position in a construction company in Qatar and I was wondering if you can buy alcohol from shops and bars or is it restricted like in other middle eastern countries.	"What has muslim got to do with this thread" 1. Alcohol is restricted because Qatar is officially a Muslim country. 2. Muslims are prohibited (by law anyway) from having a liquor or pork license and are not supposed to be served at hotel bars. We all know; of course; that many people find their way around it. MODS--please take a note of this purposeful oversensitivity and baiting. To the OP--it's easily obtainable; but expensive.	0

But just to clarify...Muslims are not prohibited by law to from having alcohol although they used to be....now a day they r prohibited from acquiring a license to purchase it for home use but they still can "LEGALLY" consume alcohol at any of the bars in town; many of which requiring memberships and none of which can legally reject any person for being a Muslim I know that because what ur saying "used to be" true and it was abolished about 3 yrs ago and announced in all bars due to an insident that happened at Irish bar at Sheraton...since then all Muslims can drink legally if they choose to do so at any establishment	1

You just need a letter from your sponsor stating your designation with your salary (All Allowances Must Be Included); Copy of RP from your passport; QR.1000/- (One time deposit).. Go to QDC; fill up the form; submit all the above. If approved; you will be granted the permit in 15min.	1
Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit?	I dont think so brother	1
Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit?	Of course assuming you are a muslim; I think you have no chance of getting a liquor license. Not sure about Qatar; but I know of a friend of mine that has an Australian passport; but he is a muslim; and they refused a license to him in the UAE. I would think unless you can provide proof to the authorities that you are not muslim; then you will have no success. Of course; I could be wrong; but I doubt it in this case.	1
Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit?	are u out of ur mind?? dont u have a littel dignity or shame?? is this the image u want to give about muslims? if u a muslim dont follow ur religion and stick to it how do u expext others to respect u and respect ur religion and convince them about it???? sooooo shocked and ur from emirates????waw what do ur parents think???	1

Your contract should tell that your status should be family; and not bachelor; so that your family will be taken here to Qatar; with all expenses paid by the company. Several companies are doing like that here in Qatar. Of course; it will be better for your to be family status; since the beginning that you are working here at Qatar. Because; not only for monetray reasons; but if your company will shoulder the expenses; they will help you in acquiring the family visa.	1

Hey there guys! I'm moving out to Doha to start work with the Ta'allum Group in Doha as a primary school teacher at (I think!) the Al Maha Academy for Boys. Is anybody else moving out there?

You should be quite suspicious if the school does not provide you with the information you require. What kind of professionalism is that? Are you sure you want to deal with bloody amateurs?	0

Well the offer of employment included information on sallary and allowances as well as the extras offered and info on what I am required to provide in terms of documentation. I know how much I will be paid; the dates covered by my contract and all of that; I am just waiting for specifics on accommodation etc... I know there are other people moving out at the same time so was hoping at least one of them might use this website and might have received some of that information. I know that I should not expect things in Qatar to be as efficient or transparent as in the UK but I have experience of working in other countries where that is also the case so like I said; I am giving the school the benefit of the doubt...	0

Does anybody know where they're supposed to be living yet? I haven't had all the info from the school yet. I wouldn't mind getting some topic info so I can plan properly really!	most schools would tell you what type of accomodation they provide at least - for example single/one bedroom fully furnished flat. Also; if they are an ongoing operation; they probably already have the flats rented and should be able to provide more particulars (i.e. photos). As for getting paid; no matter the status of your residency; they should be paying you while it goes through the bureaucracy; reputable employers do that. If for some reason you don't get an RP then they should also tell you what happens at that stage (repatriation at the school's expense).	0

how many of you buy or eat halal frozen beef meat.which is imported from other countries?	And why are you asking?	0
how many of you buy or eat halal frozen beef meat.which is imported from other countries?	anything related to mutton or beaf in qatar is halaal.	0
how many of you buy or eat halal frozen beef meat.which is imported from other countries?	This is one good article i found on net. Is Halal meat Halal? The title of this article is a bit misleading. I do eat halal meat but only that which I have either slaughtered myself or from someone I know; trust and am confident can slaughter an animal properly. This may come across as a rather elitist viewpoint but it is only that - my viewpoint which I admit is more personal that strictly religious. In my early years of Islam meat was just that; meat. I; like everyone else; simply looked for the halal logo on a packet of meat; the shop window or restaurant. I consumed a reasonable amount of meat per week. However things started to change. On one hand I started to realise that the phrase "you are what you eat" is literally true. I noticed a huge difference in my health; outlook and religious state after periods of being vegetarian. On the other hand I started to question whether halal meat was actually halal. I wondered whether we could actually trust the butchers; the producers or even the slaughter man in the abattoir. I also questioned whether the intensive exploitation of animals rested comfortably with my understanding of Islam. I concluded that there was too much doubt involved and decided to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his noble family) to leave that over which I had doubt. At one point my family had pretty much turned vegetarian. Meat rarely entered our house and the only time we ate meat was at friends' houses. Although vegetarianism is to be applauded and even encouraged; I do believe that some meat is healthy. All the Prophets ate meat with the grandfather of them all Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering the sacrifice we still commemorate every year at the end of Hajj. Upon moving to the countryside our ambition to produce; slaughter and eat our own meat finally came true. We used to buy lambs from farmers; I would slaughter them and have someone butcher it ready for the freezer. We even started to breed our own chickens. The meat was fantastic; not only did it taste different but it looked and felt different. The texture and colour of real meat! One of the benefits of living in the countryside is that you meet people that work in agriculture; these are the people that bring us our vegetables and meat. Through speaking to them I started to find out some things about both animal farming and supposed halal meat. Animals are exploited. If one sees the conditions they are born; bred and die in it would horrify anyone with a good heart. Chickens lead miserable lives in huge sheds; sharing their space and air with thousands of others. They do nothing but feed and get fat as fast as possible ready to make their way to supermarkets selling them as "Value" meat or to a Chicken Cottage on the high street. Larger animals face similar problems. Lambs are pumped full of steroids to make sure they don't die; ewes with hormones so they give birth out of season and both feed on grass treated with insecticides. Cattle are sometimes born and bred in sheds; they never see daylight or eat a blade of grass. Muslims need to ask whether this is something they are truly happy eating. Is it good to eat meat that is full of rubbish; that led a miserable life and a stressful end? Is it not possible that all this transfers into the meat? One also needs to ask if this method of farming sits with the ethos and spirit of Islam. Does Islam not teach compassion; kindness and does it not fight exploitation? To me both these elements make most of the meat in the UK inedible. I do not want to subject my body to such produce and I definitely do not want to contribute towards an industry that exploits a community that praises Allah (Quran 13:15; 17:44 and 22:18). Through an increasing interest in the whole area of meat; animal welfare and organic food I wanted to see whether local abattoirs would be open to me coming in and slaughtering animals. My talks and visits to some local abattoirs confirmed all my previous suspicions about halal meat in the UK. The first abattoir I ever called told me that there was no problem in coming and doing halal meat as they already had someone who did that. Upon questioning the abattoir it turned out that he man who did that was Muslim but did not slaughter them himself but processed them normally; meaning they were killed by non-Muslims. "He reads a prayer on them or something then gives them to us;" were the exact words. Another local abattoir informed me that "all we do is halal meat". Again after some probing I found out that none of the slaughter men were Muslim. The abattoir had actually entered into a deal with a Muslim who was processing them in this tucked away abattoir and selling the meat as halal. As you can imagine I was shocked. So as you can see; there are some people out there that do not seem to have a conscience. They are pumping out thousands of carcasses of haram meat to butchers and restaurants and you are eating it. However; my problems with halal meat do not stop there. I also question the hygiene standards of a lot of Muslim owned abattoirs. The vet at my abattoir once said to me that he has seen places in Birmingham that were "covered in shit". "How can you call that halal?" he asked me. My other issue is with the slaughter men. As someone who visits an abattoir every week and does between 10-30 lambs I know your mind drifts. It makes me question whether those that work as slaughter men full -time really remember to say "Bismillah - Allahu Akbar" or even pay attention to what they are doing. This is not their fault but a consequence of the high demand for meat and the need to process so many animals per day. As a result of all this thinking; research and experience I have made an oath not to eat halal meat ever again unless I know exactly where it has come from. I am not advocating that everyone does this as I appreciate this is not always possible; but to anyone who has taken the time to read this I would ask you to really question your relationship to meat. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are known to have made themselves sick upon discovering that the source of some food was doubtful. A lot of my conclusions are purely personal. I wish modern day Sheikhs and scholars would address the issues of intensive farming; animal rights and what we eat. This whole area is sadly lacking and needs to be examined in order to give us some guidelines. At the end of the day those that simply want meat can put their trust in a logo. It is those that want something better; for themselves; their children and animals; that need to start thinking about the meat they eat and taking some tough decisions. by Muhammad Ridha Payne Thanks.	1

In qatar; when i can take vaccination for swine flu for my 7 month old baby? please help me.	The chances that the Swine Flu virus spreads in Qatar are pretty low. That doesn't mean that you can be careless. There is not a vaccination to that particular flu yet; according to what I've read in the news (and I'm quite into reading news about swine flu; since I'm from Mexico and have all my family and friends there) is that the vaccination for Swine Flu will be ready from 4 to 6 months time. Just take care; try to keep you and your baby away from people who had been in affected areas in the last 3 weeks and that should do it. Don't panic!	0

I am thinking of studying there; but.. hesitated a bit; so.. is it safe??	In the daytime yes.... But be aware that at night the Amish roam.... with pitchforks and horse drawn buggies!!!! Seriously PA is kinda big. You need to be more specific...	1
I am thinking of studying there; but.. hesitated a bit; so.. is it safe??	yes its very safe if you do not get around bad people; then u can spend the rest of ur life in the US without any problem.	1
I am thinking of studying there; but.. hesitated a bit; so.. is it safe??	It can be as safe or dangerous as you want it to be. Having spent 20 + years in the USA; I would say it is safe. Like someone else said; PA is large; where are you going to study? It is a beautiful state; with gorgeous rural areas; bustling city; and lots to do. Outdoor activities are great; it is a hop-skip-and-jump to the New Jersey shore; New York City; and not far to get to Montreal in Canada. I would say if you have the opportunity; you may as well do it.	1
I am thinking of studying there; but.. hesitated a bit; so.. is it safe??	Where in Pennsylvania; hon? Philadelphia can be sketchy as can downtown Pittsburgh; but all other places are safe. Which school are you thinking of going to?	1

The documents you needed to be authenticated should have the red ribbon from DFA Manila. if not then the embassy here will ask you to send it to DFA Manila first before they will authenticate it. You can do it at the Philippine embassy and then after you go to Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs.	1

Embassy Doha that any documents you want them stamp it or authenticate it..you must first get authenticated it from the philippines (DFA Manila)... good luck...	1

Once back they can be presented to CEID.	1

I took my first driving test this morning and managed to pass the signal; L and parking tests. However; I got screwed in the road test (don't ask). I'm planning to retake the test sometime this month. By doing so; do you go over the test from the start? Or do you start where you left off (failed)? Like me; for example; I failed the road test; so does that mean I only do the road test? Thanks!	You need to appear only from the test you failed and do not have to repeat the passed ones. Try to get a new date; it may take quite a while i.e. around a month. Good Luck	1

My friend's father is on Qatar Airways visa (1 month) and he came to qatar on 5th January and he will leave qatar on 6th Feb.morning. and my question is; he is liable to pay any penalty ? Thanks in advance....	Hai.. Of cause he has to pay fine for the extra three days; its come QR600/- See you only told that visa is for only 1month; which means only for 30 days. He has entered Qatar on 5th of January 2009; then 30 days completes on midnight of 3rd feb. 2009. Natuarlly he has to pay fine for three days. Better to avoid fine tell your friend to preponed the ticket on 3rd of feb2009. Otherwise his father can enjoy the visit and pay the fine for extra 3 days. Hope it helps you	1

i'd like to buy puppies for a pet. but i do not know where to get one..if anyone does; please tell me the shop; place or the address..thanx.	All puppies are cute - go to QAWS and if you meet the requirements you will most likely find a companion to love you for life. However; if you don't meet the requirements - reexamine carefully your desire to get a dog. They are not a toy; they can live up to 15/16 years of age and they require good care.	0
i'd like to buy puppies for a pet. but i do not know where to get one..if anyone does; please tell me the shop; place or the address..thanx.	pet shop Sure; go ahead to the pet shop at Al Nasr street. buy a cute puppy. Just be informed that ALL pet shops in Doha are very unhygenic and have low (if any) standards. The animals are usually diseased and sick. My neighbor bought a kitten for christmas at this very shop. It died the next day. She had to threaten them with a call to the police in order to get a refund. QAWS is your best bet as they have trained vets to help them look over the animals in their care. Go there and get educated about pet ownership.	1

I recently was offered a job in Doha..I found here some useful insight about rental rates. What are the other high and costly expenses?I am also wondering about drinking water!Do people usually drink from tap or bottled water in Qatar?Since tap water got me sick once in my city!!	Qatar is indeed one of the fastest developing countries in the world. We are not living a primitive life here. However drinking Fuel is far cheaper than Mineral Water. Jokes apart; You get all kind of Mineral Water in Qatar and that too from all parts of the world. I am sure there is a brand of mineral water of Jordan as well; coz i have seen and bought Lebanese brand as well. The water is really tasty. Anyway the Tap water is very safe to drink in qatar; as long as you filter it. Water is being treated with best and latest technology here. So you need not worry. In any case you have great quality mineral water here for you to enjoy and drink ! Cheers	1

Its a nice & cool place to live. Irrespective of what water you prefer to drink;its safe and heatlthy.you can even buy water by paying 7-8riyals per 20liter or can even use tap water. Qatar is a very nice and clean country as its a small unlike our country due to 100 crores of population its very difficult for our governament to stop pollution/corruption/or dieseases spreading due to uncleanlines........something magically needs to happen to change our country's infrastructure.

I recently was offered a job in Doha..I found here some useful insight about rental rates. What are the other high and costly expenses?I am also wondering about drinking water!Do people usually drink from tap or bottled water in Qatar?Since tap water got me sick once in my city!!	Bottled water is pretty cheap and lots of places sell large jugs for water coolers. There is very little to do here and there is a caste system between the different races; so luxary items aimed at the favored nationals and food targeted at westerners as well as western housing is expensive. Though most items have cheap alternatives.	0

photography is our recreation with my hubby; and we realize it is nice management for stress. Is there any crash course for basic phography that perhaps we can apply in our near future?	You can try a distance learning course with the newyork institue of photography. I have signed up for this course about a year ago...the website is www.nyip.com. Costs 1000$. They will send you the books;DVD's and CD's and many many other things you will need. you take their tests at the end of the each module and send a photo project and you are assigned your own tutor to criticize your work and you move on according to your own pace.	1

The reason I mentioned the 5% was because there were signs posted all around town (last I saw one was about a month ago) advertising 5% interest on savings accounts. I believe it was QNB; but I'm not sure. Yes; I've heard similar bad things about HSBC. Looks like I'll be looking into QNB and Commercial Bank then. One of my most important requirements is seamless online access and transfers.	0

Hi; Getting ready for the move over and I was wondering if anyone has any tips on things you really can not get in Doha that 'at home' is just readily available. Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons. Anything esle?	The tampon shortage is long gone lol. I would advise bringing medicines thought; even though they are available here under different names I feel more comfy with my trusted brands (placebo effect I guess). If you use any specific hair care products I bring mine from home as many salon and drug store brands are not available here (Paul Mitchell; Goldwell; Joico; Aussi). Many UK food items are here in Shoprite and Mega Mart; and if they dont have it you can ask them and they will sometimes bring it in.

You can find Colemans mustard at MegaMart. You cannot get Red Wine vinegar or anything with the word "wine" in it! I do not "grocery shop" i forage; as you cannot find everything you need in one place. But you can find pretty much all you need; it will cost you though! I just moved her from London; and before that Japan; and i though it was expensive there! It was NOTHING compared to here...bring lots of cash if you want to eat like you do at home!There is a Marks and Spencer in Landmark mall that has nice food once in a while; bisquits and crisps and the like. Family Food on Al Merqab seems to have expat things usually; as well. If you can get a visit here before you move that would be helpful as well!

I really want to stop smoking. I have tried almost everything except hypnotherapy. Does anyone know any good hypnotherapist here in Qatar? Thank you all.	Best way to get rid of smoking habbit is gradually decrease the number. think of times when you just smoke for the heck of it; such as with cup of tea; as soon as you sit in the car etc and then avoid lighting up one at such times. chew a gum or carry a can of juice with you while in the car or outdoor. Dont deprive yourself by just deciding to quit; it will not work. all the best	1
Hi; I am moving over in January from Oz and I am thinking about shipping a box over to Doha; from what I can find on the net it seems to be fairly pricey; just wondering if anyone has any tips on who I should use? Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage? thanks.	It can actually be cheaper to go excess baggage - if you're travelling via Emirates you will be allowed 2 x 30Kg bags anyways - Qatar Air has a very miserly baggage allowance.

i am an indian having Qatar Residence permit (currently in India)with A profession of "Administrative". let me know is this profession eligible to get Dubai On Arrival Visa?? expecting reply....	The profession you mentioned is not listed so it will be better to check with the Airlines first. They will not let you board if the profession is not eligible to get the visa on arrival. There is no credit card payment at Dubai Airport. You should buy one e-card from the bank counter for the visa charges and that is the only one the Immigration will accept and the bank will accept any valid currencies according their exchange rates.	1
i am an indian having Qatar Residence permit (currently in India)with A profession of "Administrative". let me know is this profession eligible to get Dubai On Arrival Visa?? expecting reply....	DXB Immigration only accept cash payments at the two exchange counters at the back of the hall.

Hi;my husband has been offered a job in Qatar with a salary of 16000. we have a 3 year old child. I would like to know whether 16000 is good enough a package considering its all inclusive which means we will have to rent a 2 bedroom apartment; get a car; etc. We would like to put our child in a good Indian curriculum school. Please help me out.	First- Not very advisable to put up the name of the company with your real name. Edit that part out. Second- As for the salary; it's good enough; not great but not bad either.. Families are living on 8;000 QAR as well and I meet some families moaning about only 50;000 that they get. If he is in sales; he should get a car from the company so I guess you can cross out that from your expenditure. Every sales guy in here gets one.	1

I want to buy a laptop (Core 2 dou). Can u advise me which make I must choose.? Dell; Sony; HP....?	I have bought a DELL Studio XPS just before moving to Qatar ; but returned it right away. If you're a picky user; you will be dissapointed with the amount of heat it can generate. XPS is basically a gaming machine. Then I have bought a toshiba and very very unhappy with it; sometime it just stops working. From my previous experience; IBM T series laptops are the best one; then Dell Lattitude series.Never buy Dell inspiron series; my wife got one - very cheap made laptop. Finally if you have the budget go with the Macbook Pro - it generates less heat; battery life is also good and runs on BSD Unix on the background. You can also visit CNet or Amazon.com to see some of the reviews before even choosing one. Cheers	1

The process would be long and lots of documentations needed. I have a friend who got married here (no child) lots of documentation needed and takes long time to get their marriage certificate issued and therefore she had to fly back to her home country waiting for the attestation of the marriage certificate. Once it is done; then waiting for family visa to be processed. So get yourself ready for all the process. Good luck for your wedding.	1

I begin employment in Qatar Aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over. Is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new? How do prices compare UK Next with Qatar Next?	since u specifically about NEXT then the prices r the same...except that here u dont get EVERYTHING u find over in the UK but we do have most of the British stores.We have Debanhams;M&S;BHS and Next.But over all 1000 is way to much to pay....depending on how much clothes you have .....or need...i would humbly suggest that u evaluate yr clothes because u know the prices; u alone will be able to judge if the money will buy u what u decide to leave behind... Good luck	1

I'm kinda particular about and partial to my clothing so I brought mine. The choices here are not infinite and there isn't the catelog shopping available either.	0
I begin employment in Qatar Aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over. Is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new? How do prices compare UK Next with Qatar Next?	If you already have clothes then it's infinitely cheaper to bring them than to buy more!	1
I begin employment in Qatar Aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over. Is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new? How do prices compare UK Next with Qatar Next?	I would just want to reiterate that prices are MUCH higher here. For example yesterday in M&S looked at a pair of trousers; UK price 29.50; Qatar price 200QR; which means about 38 sterling at the current rates. Next I have found to be even worse than this. At another shop bought my son some Clarks sandles costing 245QR which would have been 30 in the UK. Talk about mark up ! I would also say that the range of clothing to the average UK taste is quite limited. As soon as you go outside of the UK shops you can run into some rather ornate clothing. The quality can be questionable aswell. Not sure how the higher end international shops compare. I am currently counting down the days til I go back to the UK in the summer and hit the summer sales ! Planning on going with empty cases and coming back with rather full ones LOL.	1

Moths will not help you being here at all. They are fluttery creatures that destroy cloth. I doubt any moth will help you at all. To be puerile though and living up to the persona some have created for me on QL.

Hi; as most indians live in qatar.... is there any temple in qatar.....	http://www.qatarliving.com/answers/living-in-qatar/any-hindu-temple write temple on the search at the right hand side u will find many threads on this topic..............	1
Hi; as most indians live in qatar.... is there any temple in qatar.....	Qatar is basically an islamic country and they see asian expats as slaves and nothi8ng more. So u may see churches here but you wont find temples. And idol worship is not allowed in islam. Hence you wont find temples here. I hope one day qatar changes the attitude of seeing asians as slaves.	1
Hi; as most indians live in qatar.... is there any temple in qatar.....	Shayampsundar....... You are prejudiced against Qatar............ why not you leave this country if your religious sentiments are being bashed..... as you claim!! Asians are slave???????????

Take it from me i have rode on both cars before; both are luxurious; both have fast acclerations and both looking pretty nice. Lexus IS 300 has more functions in it and doesnt need much of a modification since it already looks hot as stock but Infinity G35 can be modified nicely to be just as mean as Lexus. So the choice is yours. Good Luck	1

Can anyone tell me where can i buy globe roaming sim? thanks! if your selling globe roaming sim.. you can call me at +9746057424.. thnx!	i Already checked the kababayan supermarket. but they dont have globe roaming sim there. only smart. i'm using smart now just for temporary. Smart cannot be called but i'm not sure of it. My gf is globe and its too expensive for her to text to my smart because it will cost her 2php every text. Everytime my gf call me it cost her.. 20php per 1min. uhmm.. Maybe I'll try to find globe sim in souq. I hope i could get one there. Globe has a good signal here too. When i arrived here im using globe roaming sim. and its ok but it was been deactivated last thursday because my load dind'nt catch up. ehehe!Thank you!! ill try to check the stores again there or if i cant really find one here.. maybe i'll just ask my friends in phil who are going here in qatar. Thanks again! btw are you all filipino? ^_^	0

Can anyone tell me where can i buy globe roaming sim? thanks! if your selling globe roaming sim.. you can call me at +9746057424.. thnx!	simangot; i suggest your GF switch to smart sim in pinas. I will tell you some encouragement and ideas. And advantages and disadvantages of both Globe and Smart. Here it goes: With SMART; you dont have to load everyday or every week just to maintain your sim or be activated. you can do SmartLoad or Over The Air Reload once in 3 Months. The sim will be deactivated within 120 days of NO LOAD. 1 Peso text from Pinas to Internatioal Roaming Sim. Smart Signal is also good in Doha. In industrial Area is good; why not in the city. :) With GLOBE; you have to maintain a LOAD everytime for the rest of your life in abroad. Much Expensive. With Smart; when activated as Roaming Sim; Pure Text only. While Globe; you can receive/make calls but it's expensive. International Rate Charges Apply. If you happen to buy that Globe OFW Sim; it's a BULL! They said on the TV Commercials that no maintaining balance for 1 year or Forever; i dont remember anymore. It's not True! you still have to reload within 1 month of use. I guess you are working here in Doha; right? I bet you talk to your GF at night or after work or in the morning. Why don't you buy QTEL Sim from QTEL Offices. It's only 50QR now; i think they still have this Promo going on. Or better yet; there is this internet calls located in Doha. Maybe its in Souq or Industrial Area. 1 minute is to 1QR. Cheaper than using your QTEL SIm to call Pinas for 1.85QR per minute.	0
Can anyone tell me where can i buy globe roaming sim? thanks! if your selling globe roaming sim.. you can call me at +9746057424.. thnx!	GLOBE FAMILY SIM PACK comes with 1PC OFW PREACTIVATED ROAMING SIM and 2PCS FAMILY SIM sold at PHP120.00 only available at designated retail outlets in the Philippines. u would easily find it while processing some of ur papers at POEA Ortigas. Family Sim can text and call the OFW Sim at a cost of philippine local standard SMS and Calling charges. The OFW sim remains still active even at a zero load balance while abroad provided; however; any of the family sim must use the facility of SMS or calling at a time not exceeding within a month period. Anyhow; anyone of the Family Sim dont have any SMS or calling activity within a month to an OFW SIM; the service shall be automatically deactivated. Likewise; the OFW sim lost its special service capabilities. The OFW SIM will be then regarded as ordinary SIM. >	1

I want to take a Driving Classes from Gulf Driving School as it is near to my flat. Can anyone suggest me the popularity of this School?	Gulf driving school offers the best chance of you getting your licence among all the driving schools. It is popular because of the high success rate. The teaching however is terrible. So if you really want to learn driving; go to some other place. If you just want the licence; you can try gulf driving school	1

Hi ladies and gentlemen; i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.	I happen to know first hand..factors such as age; education and earnings for the past 12 mths of the applicant will be alloted 'points' and if he/she meets the minimum points for this visa category then its not a problem at all. You will have to apply from outside the UK for this; even if you are currently residing there under a different visa category. What do you want to know specifically? ~Live like there's no tommorrow~	1
Hi ladies and gentlemen; i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.	Thanks for your reply Pin; have u applied before for this type of visa? i would like to know how easy i can be accepted and how long it takes to know if i will be granted this visa.. please advise	0
Hi ladies and gentlemen; i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.	yes; i have been working and living in london for more than 1 year under a highly skilled migrant programme (HSMP) and i subsequently switched to Tier 1 (General). bear in mind - i got my visa way before the uk recession and jobs were easy to come by. now unemployment is a big issue here. you won't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job. anyways; it is unlawful to reject your application if you :- 1) have met the minimum 75 points 2) can proof that you meet the required English standard 3) have minimum funds of GBP2800. 4) obviously; you must not have any prior criminal convictions or have previously abused your immigration status(i.e. overstayed on a visa; outstanding fines in uk; etc) don't bother applying if you don't meet the above. for me; application to approval took 3 weeks; applying from KL; Malaysia. for precise requirements and how points are calculated; see http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf21pbsgeneralmigrant#6375036 good luck. ~Live like there's no tommorrow~	1
Hi ladies and gentlemen; i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.	i am so lucky to have your advice; knowing that u went through the same procedures before. what do u mean "you won't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job". actually i am not renewing; and do they gauge their approval by the required profession on top of the ones u mentioned. did u validate ur degrees with NARIC; any advice here? must be the bank statement not older than 7 days or it is fine to be a bit older? i have applied TOEFLE for more than 5 years ago; do they take this into consideration? please advise; thanks v much indeed	0
Hi ladies and gentlemen; i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.	the tier 1 general visa is for 24 months only. to extend your stay beyond 24 months you must renew it. you won't be able to do so without a job. as far as i know; you must have at least a bachelor's degree and that's how they accept that you are 'highly skilled'. they want ORIGINAL documents; no copies. don't worry they will return these to you. bank statements - latest 3 months showing minimum of GBP2800 and must be original as well. TOEFL is accepted; marks must be 110-120 (internet based test). you must also provide the original cert and test scores. ~Live like there's no tommorrow~	1
Hi ladies and gentlemen; i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.	do u think that they accept notarized copy of my certificates and not original ones? is it possible to get ur email for future correspondence? thanks so much; you have been v helpful to me	0

Can anyone advice me about my kids; can't sleep for whole night.They will start to sleep at 6am	I recommend buying them Melatonin. I started using it 3 weeks ago. I get sleepy soon after taking 2 and I have a great sleep. I don't wake up with that lingering tiredness that something like; say; Panadol Night; does. The pharmacy opposite Carrefour in Villagio definitely has it for about QR36 and I'm sure you'll find it at other pharmacies (no prescription needed of course). Best of luck!	1

Can anyone advice me about my kids; can't sleep for whole night.They will start to sleep at 6am	Dont let them sleep for a day in the morning.at night they will fall asleep.continue this for a week.they will get used.don't ever change the sheddule time.put them on bed on time.Let them be entertained during day time.and not allow at night. If they are toddlers they usually dose'nt want to sleep.they try to experience the surroundings.Make them to understand that night is to sleep or rest.Don't use lights which are bright.try not to use or a very mild power.don't encourage them at night to talk/play/have snacks..etc.So they'll feel the night boaring and they automatically go to sleep. Try some bedtime stories.give them a bed time and never ever change it.Be stricked on the rule.I think it will work out surely.	1

'm aware that Qmiles transfer fee is US$15 per 1;000 Qmiles. (online transfer) Could you kindly give me an idea how much I can sell my 100;000 Qmiles. Many thanks.	The cost of buying 1000 Qmiles directly from Qatar Airways is QR 120. You should accept no less than QR 80 per 1000. Many people would want to spend money on transfer; rather they want you to go with them to the Qatar Airways office to permit the use of the Qmiles you agreed on; they will pay you the agreed amount; and pay Qatar Airways the taxes and other fees.	1

We are moving to Qatar but shipping of all our belongings won't arrive for nearly 5 weeks after we do. We can't decide if it's best to pay excess bagage and bring items like child port-a-cot and car seat with us or put in shipping. Is there a company in Qatar that do short term hiring out of items including cots; car seats; high chairs etc?	i saw the same in Lulu / carrefour	0

I have travelled the UK; South Africa and Switzerland and I have always been able to take my stroller; car seat and travel cot with me at no extra charge. Phone the airline and find out!	1

Is there a company in Qatar that do short term hiring out of items including cots; car seats; high chairs etc?	Definitely phone the airline. The baggage rules have changed a LOT and we nearly got stung for US$525 for three bags earlier this month. As recently as October 2008 you could fly from the U.S. to Doha on Qatar Airways without the carseats counting toward your baggage requirement at all. In other words; you were allowed two bags per passenger. . .so if there were two adults and two (paying) kids then you were allowed eight bags PLUS the two car seats. But no longer. . .now you would be allowed six bags plus two car seats. Anything over that costs US$175 *per bag*. We learned this the hard way; so it's not an urban legend for us :(	1

I am not aware of any companies that hire them out. Car seats; in particular; are generally not used outside of the expatriate crowd. :( You can find what you need at the City Center Babyshop store; but depending on your luggage situation it might just make sense to bring it with you.	1

Well; it's a bit more complex than that. If she gets a job that allows her to stay under her husband's sponsorship she can change without an NOC. Some jobs require you be under their sponsorship.

Wheres the Greek Embassy in Doha? Contact details would be appreciated... Thanks! :)	Consular services for Greek nationals Cyprus Embassy in Doha is represents the consular interests and diplomatic protection of Greek nationals who live and work in Qatar since there is no Greek Embassy in the country. Greek nationals can certify documents; signatures and ask for a permanent resident certificate. The price for the certifications is 5 (around QR40 depending on exchange rate) Also Cyprus Embassy keeps a mailing list where Greeks and Cypriots who live and work in Qatar are encouraged to register. The mailing list is updated daily and every effort is made for the best accuracy. The Embassy distributes security information when necessary and other important information to the registered nationals. The Greek Ambassador to Qatar is the Ambassador of Greek Embassy in Kuwait. Since Cyprus has not started issuing shengen visas yet; visa applications for Greece are being processed by the Embassy of France. For more information please contact the consular section of the Embassy. check this link; http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Doha.nsf/All/85D1B7B79AB8FFFE432571D4002E8729?OpenDocument	1

i mean if they caught you dating someone who is not your husband or wife?	Dating isn't an issue; its having a sexual relationship that is the issue. I think jail would come into it if one of the parties was married. Still; could be worse; its stoning in some other countries!	1
i mean if they caught you dating someone who is not your husband or wife?	well yes; if they find you kissing or _____ in public or even in room (if some one saw you and complain) so better be careful. dating is not a issue; doing something nasty will bring trouble for you. so Ms strawberry; u can go for date ...	1

Dear Qlers; can you please advise how i can bring some books from dubai to Qatar books belong to physiotherapy used books for my reference. appreciate your kind guidance. 5-6 books only	well; then i guess you could check and see who is coming to qatar from dubai; and request them to get the books for you. but to be honest; i don't think anyone would be willing to fill in 8-9 kgs of their own luggage space; just to get books for someone else! ; thinkin this way; you might find the shipment option more helpful! you might have to do a little homework on checking out which shipment companies gives you the best price; and instruct the seller/sender accordingly :) alternately; try looking for those books in qatar; i.e. in jarir bookstore.	1

One of my friend is working here in Qatar for 4 years;he is planning to resign and go back to his country of origin.He was asking does the company will give any seperation pay?if yes;how is it to be computed?lenght of service or whatsoever?	1-calculation of gratuity as per qatar labor law is 21 days basic salary of each year. if u worked 5 years or more it will become 1 month basic salary instead of 21 days. 2. Each year u have a right to get 21 days leave salry; if u not get in previous years; u can claim for this also. 3. All of the calculation based on the last basic salary u got. Eg. suppose on the time of ur joining ur basic salary is 5000 and now u r getting the basic salary 7500; the calculation is based on the last one measns 7500. 4. If ur contract is defenit contract u should give 2 weeks notice informing ur resignation. if ur contact is indefinit duration contact u must give 1 month notice about ur resignation. other wise they can deduct 1 month salary or remaining balance of days salary from ur settlement.	1

Thank you in advance.	You can find 1BHK semi furnished brand new flats including water and electricity in Doha at Qrs 3500-4000 per month. Grocery; 1000- 1500 Qrs. Petrol and other maintenances; 300-500 if you have an economy car in good condition. Telephone and internet; 250-500. So total monthly expense will come around 6500 - 7000 maximum. You can save half of your salary if you have a good plan. Good luck go ahead this is a good job offer if the company and project is real.	1

Thank you in advance.	For single it is okay. But for married you won't be saving anything. 1000-1500 living expenses is good for one person only. House rent and food will eat most of your salary. Transportation or car maintenance and education fees is an additional burden to your meagre salary.	1

One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar; he got permanent Qatari Driving license; can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?	How did he get a Qatari Driving License (permanent) without having a Residence Permit and ID?	0
One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar; he got permanent Qatari Driving license; can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?	cherukkan; He might have got the temporary DL and is confused. They will not issue Permanent DL without RP and ID. A person on visit visa will not have a Permanent DL of Qatar and will not be able to buy a car.	1
One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar; he got permanent Qatari Driving license; can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?	please get your facts straight as you cannot get a Permanent Drivers License without an RP. The license is link to your QID and bear the same number.	1
One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar; he got permanent Qatari Driving license; can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?	the license is connected to the Qatari ID.. if the visa is cancelled the license will have no meaning as well.. he is driving at his own risk similar to not having a license.. if he gets a new sponsor and gets a new qatari id he will again need to apply for a new license to be linked to that new ID.	1
One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar; he got permanent Qatari Driving license; can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?	Dohamarketing is right. You don't need a Driving License to buy a car but you need an RP to buy a car. His Driving License is invalid as his visa was cancelled and he should renew it after obtaining the RP.	1

Which are good fish/pet shops in Doha that would sell fish tanks; aquarium supplies and fish? (both salt water and fresh fish) Are there Aquarium social clubs in Doha?	I have a fully-equipped Jebo tank & stand (black) that I'd like to sell in case anyone is interested. It's either 180 or 240 litres; I think. I set it up once but then had to move before I added any fish. I was going to set it up as a heavily planted tank; so it comes with a cable heater; CO2 system; inline heater; Eheim filtration (in addition to the built-in filtration) etc. PM me for details.	0

Before everyone shouts at me - I did a search and the info seems to be a bit old.(2006-2007) So at the risk of being ridiculed - can I just ask a simple question? Can I rent a car with an international driving license while waiting for my residency permit? Even if I have been here longer than 7 days? Its all very confusing!	I came to Qatar and rent a car with my International Driving license until my RP was ready;if u want I can give you the office name i rented the car from. So irresponsible answers from the mentioned person should be ignored. Good luck my friend ; Enjoy Qatar it is a lovely country.	1

Dear QL'ers esp my kababayans; My family and I are planning of taking one month vacation to the Philippines this coming December. My question is; is there a specific month where booking reservations are cheaper? Can you also suggest a travel agency or an airline?	..from experience though; early reservation will give you lower costs..and try to avoid pinas during vacations and pinas holidays...	1

I know i'm allowed to eat a lot of other foods; so maybe you can help me out with your suggestions? What's your no-carb recipe?	I was/am on Atkins quite frequently and lost weight also. But I found some problems like getting hyper on staff/customers; not been able to talk much etc etc. So I dont observe atkins regularly. May be two weeks on atkins and then break for some days/week and then again on atkins. Yes atkins certainly helped me in loosing weight . Foods you can include (apart from chicken) is eggs ( all type); zero cola; bottle gourd; egg plant; okra;cheese; fish; tuna; salads. One thing more is>>> lime juice once in day (especially in morning before food). This is not recommended in Atkins coz of bit high in carb but it help in making your food balance to more alkaline compared to acidic food.	1

Well;i never tried getting so fat and too skinny in my entire life.maybe it's an advantage that I don't like to eat something sweet. I eat chocolates once for two months or nothing at all.

I don't know if you guys have read the article in the local english newspaper about some scientific findings that exercising is actually not the key to being skinny....I think that's bull; though. And anyway; scientists always scares me. Them and their "findings". I do try to get exercise when I can; which is not a lot of times since i'm soooo busy lately. If I can't do that; I go do Atkins. I loooove eating; and i get so guilty that I have to diet after. It's like a yo-yo diet. Not good; I know; but what do I do when I don't have time for exercise?	0

I know i'm allowed to eat a lot of other foods; so maybe you can help me out with your suggestions? What's your no-carb recipe?	I have found that Atkins in Qatar is really difficult... I lost over 50kgs on it and kept it off for 3 years (including 2.5years in Qatar) - then about 2 years ago; I just couldn't contain myself with all the good food - hummous; arabic bread; naan; butter chicken... etc... Techincally; I shouldn't have had a much of a problem - you can eat kebab with Rocket leaves and onions - or in salad - chicken doesn't have to be your only option. Brunch at a Hotel on Sundays is brilliant - Berries; eggs and turkey/beef bacon; sausages; meat - thats all allowed. What about making a smoothie of cream; berries and ice? Omelettes with mushrooms; greem peppers; diced chicken and cheeze.... There are lots of choices.... Have you seen this.... http://www.atkins.com/Program/low-carb-online-tools.aspx There is a tab that will take you to meal plans and recipes.... try it:-) You have just inspired me to start again....	1

I don't think I inspire you...I think it is the other way around! Thanks for sharing. :) From what I know; I'm not allowed to eat fruits. Berries are fruits; right? I'm still in induction phase; sorta. I'm at it for almost 2 weeks now; and believe you me; I lost almost 3 kilos already! It works; it works; it works people! Ok; after the induction phase then I can start introducing carbs in my diet...by now i've no appetite for carbs; really. I've lost it couple of days ago. I'm just bored with the same old food that's all. I guess my problem is i'm too tired to prepare something new and something on my own. Lazy; lazy; lazy. Eating out is a pain; since if you eat steaks (which I loooove) you get carbs as side dish. I don't want to be tempted! Quickest way is the good ol' chicken. I shouldn't complain I know. I'm switching to kebab. Thanks for the tips; i'm going to try out your suggestions!	1

I used to work out for an hour and a half 5 days a week and was skinny as a rail. Used to eat & drink whatever I wanted and wouldn't gain a pound.

What are the advantages of starting a business in Qatar than in other countries?	Never ever think of starting a business in Qatar. I know I sound stupid. But believe me. The rules are one hell of sucking rules. If you go to the government office one day they will say one thing and second day they will say they dont want what they said on 1st day. I have been trying to setup an organization here for the past 4 months. No luck at all. And believe me; they want only want MNC to come to Doha.

What are the advantages of starting a business in Qatar than in other countries?

Im trying to find out where can I get this supplement. I called GNC; Khouloud pharmacy; Tylos pharmacy; and none have it. HELP!	It's one of the most common medicines around but seem to have a shortage throughout Qatar at the moment. It happens to quite a lot of medicines here.

Im trying to find out where can I get this supplement. I called GNC; Khouloud pharmacy; Tylos pharmacy; and none have it. HELP!	My wife is on these supplements for low stomach acid; she has not joined me out here yet; but we were going to get them sent from the UK as we weren't sure if they are available here. It might be worth trying the internet if you have a PO box that they can be sent to; when my wife ran out of them she found it helpful to eat an orange with a meal as this does increase the stomachs ability to break down the fats. Don't use a lemon as these turn alkiline in the stomach and make the problem worse. Good luck	1

The painter that our compound mgmt sent over was clearly gouging us - he wanted 1;500QR per room; which is more than it would cost in the U.S. .. .and I know the guys here are making much much less than the immigrant labor in Texas. Any recommendations for someone who will do a good job for a fair price? Thanks; Expat Sueo	Painting is very easy and a fun job to do. You can buy the paint at any Jotun shop; where they will mix it by computer to any shade you want. Then get some rollers and do it yourself. You will save a lot of money and you will feel so much better after you have completed the job. Really rewarding. I love painting my house and have done everything myself. Aisha-Taweela	0

Hi guys I just got a parking ticket :( Does anyone know how much I'll have to pay? Can't get into moi.gov.qa at the moment. thanks	"Driving a vehicle loaded in such a way that it cause damage to people and surroundings" - this usually means speeding and it is caught by the radar at traffic lights if you cross the speed limit for that road. You can go to Traffic Dept at Old Airport or Madinat Khalifa and request to see a video of the violation. Ur dad can tell if its his car and move accordingly. The place zones can often be misleading due to error in data entry. But timing will be accurate; only our minds play tricks on timings. Worth checking out the video than speculating.	0

We might be moving to Qatar next year; and I was wondering; I would like to have my kids in a nursery; can they start in the middle of the year; or do they have to wait until august?

However some provide summer programs for the kids who stay in Doha; but you would need to register before the available positions fill up.	1

They are positioned (and funded) to make great contributions international media. Unfortunately; as long as they allow someone's politics to color their reporting; they will be marginalized.

It's kind of scary when you think that the Daily Show (which I love and do watch daily--at least on the 4 days a week it runs) could be the primary source of news for certain demographics in the US. I like the PBS News Hours. It's the only US show that actually covers the days news in depth. BBC world does a good job. Fox news is appalling in its slant; especially as it pretends to be objective news (at least MSNBC; which slants in the other direction doesnt pretend to be news instead of opinion). CNN is OK. Outside the US and UK; Al Jazeera International really does do a good job of presenting a more third World centered view. As for Qatar news: fugetaboutit; best source seems to be QL	1

Even if a certain tv news channel is truthful; it will focus on issues that are of interest to her which does not make things objective. However; I would vote for the Arabic Al-Jazeera.	1

my offer is basic salry 1500 usd; a car and the housing are on the own of te company (not shared housing).The job is a kind of management position; nationality lebanese. Thx by advance to all	I work for the government and all my Qatari counterparts make the same as I do.... in all the departments based on grade and we are more than 1000 employees. Private companies may differ but anything on a grade all the salaries are the same or within a specific range. Only difference is the social allowance; which I dont get but as they are Qataris they dont get housing.... With my housing allowance I actually make more than my Qatari counterparts. As for their inflated titles; thats a different story. I have a person in a position above me who gets to sit and read the paper all day and make double my salary... thats something different all togther. _______________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	1

Me and my friends are planning to take a trip to Dubai by car this Eid. My questions are: 1. Where can we get visa to Dubai? 2.

I think that you might have left it a bit late.. As you will travelling through Saudi Arabia to UAE then you require a Transit visa. Normally KSA embassy here in Qatar stop issuing Transit visa about two weeks before the Eid.. The rest of the trip is not worth mentioning if youhave not this first step..	1

Do You Think Qatar Will Be Like Dubai after how many Years????	Rasha; ask yourself; "why does Dubai have all the things Qatar doesn't?" You should find the simple answer that Dubai's Oil and Gas reserves are dwindling and they are boosting tourism as a revenue earner. Qatar is sat on a huge gas bubble and doesn't <i>need</i> tourism as much. And at the end of the day; if you like Dubai and what it has to offer so much; you could always move there; but till then; be satisfied with what you adopted host country has to offer. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3450023228/" title="West Bay Panorama April 2009 by baldrick2dogs; on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228_950f2210ff_m.jpg" width="240" height="68" alt="West Bay Panorama April 2009"	1

Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	What's unusual is that you get what you pay for. With many of the schools in Doha you can pay a fortune and still not receive a good education.	1

Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	qatbrit has used the right 'their' and 'there' in her message - have I missed something??! Having just visited a number of schools in Qatar I was very much impressed with the importance placed on learning the 3'Rs in primary school. I know for a fact in the UK that in British schools the spelling is appalling - teachers don't want to correct mistakes just in case the feelings of the child are knocked!! I personally found Doha College to be way above its station - unable to respond to emails requesting a visit and then when they did; they could not arrange a whole school visit requiring us to visit twice if we wanted to see both primary and secondary. I will not bother - I can not imaging how they would deal with a case of bullying if a whole school visit was beyond their capabilities. Maybe they don't need more pupils coming to their school - I do know that resting on your laurels is never good. I expect the teachers at Doha College are good but if their administration is as weak as it appears parents will take their children elsewhere for fear of bad management. First impressions still count!	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	How much can the extras go up to a Sherborne? Are those usually covered by the company? And how have you folks found the school so far? It seems to offer a lot of extra-curricular activities and has a good backing. Any other schools that you'd recommend - my sons are 6 and 3.5 Cheers	0

Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Hi; I am a mother of a 6 yr old boy and is looking for a good school in Doha. I recently got a call for an opening for my son at Sherborne.I am confused as I have also heard about ASD that its also a very good school. As yr child is in Sherborne; Can you please let me know how the school is? should I opt for Sherborne or wait for ASD to reply? How are the teachers at Sherborne? Hows the atmosphere? are u satisfied? Please let me know your feedback. I will really appreciate. Thanks;	0
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Sherborne Qatar is a school run as a business making profit. It is owned by one of the Al-Thani mob. There are lots of problems with this school. Many higly experienced teachers left after just one year and a another teacher recently quit. They have tried to set up a British Prep school in the desert - it just does not work. Few of the remaining staff have much international experience - most of them are snobby types from the UK with little overseas experience or knowledge about Arab customs. The organisational of the school is poor - reactionary management. Contact with the Head is limited. They have a Board of Govenors made up of pompous types. There are very few decent schooling options in Qatar and it looks like that Sherborne Qatar will never live up to the advertised promises. Avoid for now - far too many problems related to cultural adjustment.	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Susan Chang; you make lots of claims but what is your proof? Do you have or did you have a child at Sherborne? My personal experience as a qualified teacher; who has supported many of the students at Sherborne; has been very positive. In fact I was sceptical about how well a new school could do in its first year. I have been quite surprised by what they have achieved so far both academically and in terms of students' holistic development.	0
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	My proof is that I am friends with several teachers and families currently at the school or who have recently left. I stand by all I have said. There are really no decent schools in Qatar. It is absurd to think you can set up a British Prep School in the middle of the desert. The whole operation is a business shum run for money - a profit making venture trading upon a famous name. There are a bunch of pompous UK Govenors who have a lot of egg on their faces at the moment and are doing everything to avoid swallowing their pride. The only reason the majority of the teaching staff did not leave last year is because they were granted a 10% lump cash sum payment to basically remain hush and avoid speaking out. What more would you like to know? The only reason the school survived its first year was because of the teachers; not for any other reason. The same can be said for many if not all the schools in Qatar.	0
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Quite frankly any school in Doha indirectly helps to sustain a corrupt system of government (a Family Dynasty); that directly depends on the mass importation of hundreds of thousands of poor people from countries like Nepal; Bangladesh; India and Pakistan. These people are totally exploited and treated like modern day slaves. They survive on about 800 QR a month. No school in Doha can deny that they indirectly helps to sustain such a system. That is why I say that there are no good schools in Doha. Their moral foundations are corrupt. It has nothing to do about IVY league universities. Decent people should get out of this sham of a country. Sherborne UK has jumped into bed with a corrupt family and have had their fingers badly burnt. They now lack integrity and all that they propose they stand for back in the UK.	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	we moved from Dubai too and my kids are going to the same school; they seem to be alright however I am not quite sure about how strong are they in their acadamics	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	but using your own logic; you and your husbands jobs (or you emotionally supporting your husbands decision to work here in Qatar) are sustaining your employers; who in turn; are "sustaining corrupt family monarchies who deny their citizens and visitors basic human rights and freedoms". Therefore the only logical option open to you is to leave. This is the first time I have suggested that anyone should leave Qatar - but unfortunately this is the corner you have painted yourself into.	0
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	first of all; the only reason Sherborne established a branch here because it's part of the supreme council of education "Education for a New Era" Outstanding Schools Initiative. which is a RAND initiative (if you know what i mean).So far; Qatari students accounts for less than 10% of the total number of students . Most Qataris enroll their offspring in government schools. Overall; Private schools target expatriates who works here; and the fact is most of the expatriates who enrolls their offspring in private schools receives education allowance from their employers And let's be honest; most of you wishes deep inside that your countries are a monarchy. The immigrants are sucking your resources dry; Degrading your national health & education systems. Despite all that your salaries are deducted as taxes to pay for the welfare of those immigrants. And yet; you got to pay for utilities ;)	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Hello Genesis; Would you adopt a Affirmative or Negative viewpoint? Schools like Sherborne have put into place racially discriminatory quota systems of not enrolling more than 20% Qatari students; not 10% as you did suggest. Of course Sherborne can get away with this in Qatar and would never be able to implement such an unfair policy back in the UK. Your paragraph about immigrants sucking the national health and education system dry is sheer nonsense. A simple and poorly worded opinion without evidence or substance. As for Adley; I am pleased that you have managed to reach some sort of conclusion. I really think that all highly trained Western Expats including yourelf should leave Qatari; not just me! More debate is required.	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	School demographics is an issue in the UK just as much as it is in Qatar. It is difficult to maintain a high standard of learning if a large proportion of students in a classroom are not fluent in the language of instruction. The way most private schools in the UK address this issue is by setting a limit on the percentage of non-native speakers of English. Otherwise; the majority of the population in these schools would consist of Indian and Chinese students. This is because of the sheer volume of applicants from these two countries. In Qatar those schools; with a small population of first language English speakers; such as QIS and Al-Jazeera Academy; tend not achieve the same standards as those with more first language speakers. This does not mean that those students who are not fluent in English are less able but it does show that not being fluent in a language can be a barrier to learning.	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Academic integrity of school 2 Effectiveness of administration 2 Academic and disciplinary support provided 2 Director's involvement in academics 2 Fair and equitable treatment by board and director 2 School has adequate educational materials on hand 5 Attitude of local community towards foreigners 5 Cost of living in relation to salary (10= most favorable) 3 Satisfaction with housing 2 Community offers a variety of activities 6 Availability and quality of local health care 6 Assistance with visas; shipping and air travel 1 Extra curricular load is reasonable 5 Comments: Sheikha Aisha owns and operates this substandard 'international' school. Don't be fooled; it's an international school in theory but an Islamic school for delinquent Al Thani children. All the students that have been expelled or refuse entrance to another school know they can attend Doha Academy. Mr. Farouk; head of the secondary school; is abully who rules through intimidation. He has his minions who follow him around like hungry puppies hoping that he'll throw a bone their way. Anyone who dares to stand up to him is a target of his. He derives immense pleasure in humiliating and demoralizing students. How this man was ever appointed in a school boggles the mind. Sheikha Aisha; the owner/operator; is notorious for not honoring contracts. Foolishly I thought that once a contract was agreed to and signed; it would be honored. Not so. She has blatantly broken contracts because she decided she didn't want to pay airfare. The Sheikha is a dishonest; disreputable woman who is only after two things; money and prestige. She's getting plenty of cash from the parents but refuses to reinvest it in the school. Working for Sheikha Aisha is a miserable experience. Now that she has turned the day to day operations over to Mr. Ali as Head of Secondary Girls and Mr. Farouk as head of secondary boys; the school will take a dramatic downward spiral. (As an aside; both Mr. Ali and Mr. Farouk have in the past been taken to the police for assaults on students. These assaults took place during normal school hours. Members of staff intervened in order to stop the altercation from becoming a brawl. Yet; they remain thanks to the Sheikha.) Unless you want to work for and be sponsored by a woman who has zero integrity; no qualms about breaking a contract and no ethics; run a million kilometers in the opposite direction. No one of any repute should ever consider working at this school.	1
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	Wow susan..those are pretty inside stuff you're bringing out. I've my child going to sherborn in reception and so far i'm pleased with the teacher and school system. Though this is my first year and i've yet to explorer. but my child is happy. I guess what ever happens in the background as long as it does not direclty effect the teching Quality. but assaulting the student is a serious crime if this is true.	0
Has anyone else had problems dealing with the School? They seem very uncertain over so many important issues.	We are all looking for the same standard of education they we get at home; and if we are putting our children into a private school; then the standard should be even higher. Not seeing this with Sherborne; they are doing what all the other schools do and that's drop the level because they have too many 2nd langugage students. Sherborne; is being filled with too many children to soon just to but bums on seats; and running on it's reputation from the UK. It has no western admin staff; a balance would nice. Why is that private schools are running with 22+ in class; in England a private operates with 12 maybe 15. The homework is shocking; no grammar; no comprehension; no maths; science; history; french; geography yet to had this term....thinking about moving my child if things do not improve.	1

Souq Waqif [go with decent clothes on Thursday night;Friday & Saturday nights too] 2. Almost all Malls [go with <b>extremely</b> decent clothes] as i have seen those security guards they always stop labourers with untidy clothes (or) no sense of clothing at all. 3. Souq Area for Shopping 4. Musheirib Area to meet more of your bachelor friends if you visit it on THURSDAY & FRIDAY NIGHTS. 5.

Your best bet is to contact Mohammad Bin Sulayem (the Middle East Rally Champion) in Dubai. He has a performance shop where he upgrades and work only with super engine cars. I know him in person and his passion towards racing cars in general and Ford in particular would probably entice him to find a way for solving your problem.

Thx	if your phone is an old 3G you can downgrade the baseband via fuzzyband even though you updated to 3.1.3 however; if you are on a 3GS you need to wait until a new unlock is unveiled which will only be released when Apple releases a new Major update as the unlock teams currently do not wish to reveal their current exploits until a major update is released by Apple. All the best; Chad p.s. hope you are running a 3G :)	1

Dear All I would like to know that is there any rule in qatar labor law which states that a person can get a marriage paid leave for certain amount of time? your answers and suggestion would be greatly appreciated.	Not sure about Qatari Labour Laws; but our companys gives 7 days for such leave.	1

Dear All I would like to know that is there any rule in qatar labor law which states that a person can get a marriage paid leave for certain amount of time? your answers and suggestion would be greatly appreciated.	It amazes me that a Qatari asks such questions; thought they would no more than the rest of us. I suppose though Marriage is a death; either to the husband (slow and lingering) or to the wife if she changes her name; the birth of a new woman (already mature) and the death of the old as the name no longer applies.	0

I'm moving to Qutar on Friday (in 2days. What can I wear? What can't I wear? Can I wear knee length dresses and skirts? Can they be just above the knee?	You can wear whatver you want as long as it doesnt draw attention to yourself. Clothes that cover you and dont show too much skin is ok. You can wear skirts or trousers or jeans or dresses. As long as there is not too much skin show anything is ok...Welcome to Doha!	1
I'm moving to Qutar on Friday (in 2days. What can I wear? What can't I wear? Can I wear knee length dresses and skirts? Can they be just above the knee?	Yes I guess Tinkerbell has kind of summed it up. Skirts up to Knee roll are ok I guess..:) Welcome to Doha	1
I'm moving to Qutar on Friday (in 2days. What can I wear? What can't I wear? Can I wear knee length dresses and skirts? Can they be just above the knee?	You have to remember that Qatar is a conservative Muslim Country by Law; but as with most places a lot of the rules are bent here. The one thing you have to remember which was states before you do not want to wear something that is to revealing so that people do not give you a hard time. For females you can wear whatever you want but then you have to deal with the after math of having inappropriate comments being made and in some cases harassment from both the people and the police. For men its is a lot easier but some times the same problems arise. So the best advice i can give is that you dress for the summer but nothing to revealing.	1

I'm looking to obtain work out of canada or do business elsewhere; simply because I need a change. Any 'short cuts' any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.	Good question my friend. I started in the oil industry 20 years ago with no experiance or reletive qualifications. 20 yeras on I'm now working for an Oil Company in Qatar but to start with i started working for a service company. Drop me an e-mail through Qatar living and I will try and give you few pointers in the right direction	1
I'm looking to obtain work out of canada or do business elsewhere; simply because I need a change. Any 'short cuts' any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.	Short Cuts might benefit you only for a short period. There is no short cut to success according to me. If you have luck by your side; you can do miracles; if you dont then you need to struggle the hard way. Oil & Gas Industries dont have kids running the show; Professional experience and solid education back ground is need in these sectors. Good Luck	1
I'm looking to obtain work out of canada or do business elsewhere; simply because I need a change. Any 'short cuts' any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.	It is not necessary to have oil related experience or education to get a job in the oil industry. All kind of profesional is needed in the oil industry be it on IT; Engineering; legal; medical or even teacher.	1
I'm looking to obtain work out of canada or do business elsewhere; simply because I need a change. Any 'short cuts' any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.	1- Find the names of as many oil companies and contractors as posible; prepare a good CV (Resume) using the best of your knowledge focus in what ever you know how to do best (don't lie); give a title to your CV (for example: HR officer; secretary; tea boy what so ever) now apply online and personally against all positions available related to the field you know best. 2- Keep your phone with ya; you don't want to missed a call!! while waiting for any interview appointments; go to get urself a good suit and polish your shoes lol (shave and cut ur hair); you only get one chance to make a good impression and be lucky enough to have "the golden opportunity to "develope ur new career"; be confident at all times. " THAT SHOULD DO IT" GOOD LUCK!	1

There are cameras at the Tornado Tower intersection and at the CBQ Tower intersection near the General Post Office. You get caught if you jumped a red light. Good Luck.	0

I eventually didn't receive a ticket; which means that if you mistakenly cross the lights while orange on your side of the intersection; and become red by the time you reach the other end of the intersection; you should be fine.	0

You can try http://www.kayak.com/ . And I aggree with UKEng; Expedia.com will be good too. But; you need to have a credit card which is issued by Canadian/US institution - that's the drawback of expedia & cheaptickets. Good luck	1
I am looking for the best fare flight from Doha to Houston; It is no need to be directly flight. Anyone can suggest me?	best fare or best flight.... I once had a cheap KLM flight; through Amsterdam (a 24hour flight) I prefer the direct Qatar Airways flight (preferably in Business Class) It's a direct DOH-IAH 17h flight (10am to 5:30pm same day) the flight back is a 15h flight (7:45pm to 7:45pm next day) ... Timezone differences make the numbers seem illogical :)	1
I am looking for the best fare flight from Doha to Houston; It is no need to be directly flight. Anyone can suggest me?	Like mentioned before; Qatar Airways is the best bet. A flight from Doha to Houston will be around 1400 usd depending on the time of year you go. For example; a flight near Christmas time would be a couple hundred dollars more expensive. I've searched taking a longer flight with layovers and it is always over a thousand more so it's sooo not worth it.	1

Click on Begin test and let it choose a good server automatically. check your packet loss; if high then cable issue. Then to check your download and upload speed go to www.speedtest.qa. I had some problems with mine; then changed the router and also found out my connection was downgraded from 4mb to 1mb and took them 2 weeks to fix that; but its all good now.	1

And Hasan is right to a certain extend;you can't clean that "place" toroughly only if using water;this is common sense. I will not say westerners are dirty people;but I look at this type of hygiene -paper- totally disgusting. And a body with no smell doesn't automatically mean a clean body.

Three things caught my attention right away 1. Water in public washroom; even at the airport. 2. Speed limit and driving style 3. I saw one kid (2-3 yrs old); with no child seat and seat belt on which was pretty scary. I think it is nothing wrong with using water in a washroom; this is just some people do not have courtesy to leave it clean for the next person. Qatar is one of the richest country (per capita income in 2007 was more than 80K i guess) on this planet; so it is fair to expect that everything should be nice and clean in this country. hopefully I did not hurt anybody's feelings.	0

I would equally complain if dirty bog-roll was left strewn all over the bathroom; so I think there's no excuse for leaving excrement-laden spray covering the cubicle. However; the problem would be much less apparent if the water drained away properly.	1

When you arrive at Doha airport and want to use the toilets (speaking of the ladies' of course; can't comment on the gents') the first impression of Doha is NOT GOOD!!! Only 2 toilet cubicles; both dirty and swimming in dirty water and overflowing bins. Why oh why can't they build decent toilets in this country?? The toilets in the new malls esp. Villaggio are HORRIBLE!! Cheaply constructed from formica - water and dirty paper everywhere. Is it really so difficult?? Go to the malls/hotels/ airport in Dubai and you can see the difference. Why can't it be the same here?? I will do anything to avoid using public toilets here; which is sometimes very inconvenient; but I don't want to bare my b*m to these hellholes!!	0

So fingers physically touch faeces?...nice 2) Do you use the paper afterwards to ensure all has been removed and to also dry off ones bum? 3) If one doesn't use paper to dry surely it would cause soreness? 4) How come the water goes everywhere? 5) Surely the backsplash from the faecal/urine filled toilet water lands directly back on ones netheregions? I'm not convinced...one has to use paper somewhere along the line Water all over the floor which I dread to think what lurks in it is quite disgusting and unacceptable.....	0

Why public toilets in Qatar are so dirty Even you go to 5 star hotels or any good restaurants there toilets are spilled with water all over. Is it necessary to have a water in toilets ? In western world there is no water in the public toilets and they are very clean. Last week i went to Shark Village one of the top hotels in the country and was not able to use the toilet as it was all spilled with dirty water suggestions please	All this talk of toiletary taboos might help explain the incredibly high rate of sterility amongst the local population. It can't be clean having so much urine and faeces swirling around on the floor; walls and misting into the air. Perhaps that's why the local men and women have so much trouble conceiving.	0

Here in Qatar it is such an ordeal to stand in queue in some public place or in huge crowd because of smelly stinky odor from certain folks who do not believe in washing their bodies and clothes before venturing in public Again; have you ever seen filthier bathrooms than here: Landmark; City Center; Waqif; Hyatt; Villagio; McDonalds; Burger King; ....... everywhere!!!!!

I'd rather piss against a wall than set foot in those toilets again. Whoever is 'running' Souq Waqif is useless. The place is an utter embarrassment for tourists in that regard. If you want anyone to have a meal and spend more than an hour there; they will need toilets... and this is the number 1 place to take tourists in Qatar? I guess it's a true reflection of the filthy attitude of many people in this country. No wonder western tourists hate the place.	0

Why does everyone just accept that this is the way things are in Qatar? It just boggles my mind that management at all the major shopping centers fell no compulsion to offer clean and sanitary toilets to patrons; or that the municipality doesn't enforce any cleanliness standards. I just don't know how people can live like that.	0

OK. The rumors about the demolition of Gold's Sym appear to be unfounded- I was just there last night looking through the windows and everything is set up like they were ready to open at any moment. So; what is the deal? Are they really closed? If so; why is everything still set up and the lights are on (but nobody's home).	That's so odd! I was thinking of joining back in May but they said they weren't taking new members as they were closing down!?! I would also be interested in knowing if they are re-opening. Anyone know?	1

I work in the UK on a salary of 17;000GBP after tax. I have a feeling my company will be offering me a comparable salary to work in Qatar. This does not include any benefits; so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. I am a British citizen; 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish. What do you fine citizens of QL think?	No way near enough if you have to pay your own accomodation. check QL classifieds to get an idea of the going rate for apartments. EVERYTHING here is more expensive; except for petrol. You need to be making a good deal more than you were in the UK.	1

This does not include any benefits; so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. I am a British citizen; 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish. What do you fine citizens of QL think?	Just to give you a brief idea about living costs in Qatar; take a good look at these facts: 1- Rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in a mid-class area is from 3;500 up to 4;500 QAR per month. Sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1;000-1;500 QAR per month. 2- Renting a small car (1500 cc) is around 1;500-1;700 QAR per month. 3- Food costs for a single per month are around 800-1;500 QAR depending on what you eat and drink. The previous number increments if you drink alcohol. 4- Going out on weekends costs around 200-300 QAR depending on what you do (that's about 800-900 QAR per month). 5- Water and electricity bills are around 300 QAR per month. Any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 QAR each (that's another 500 QAR per month). Need I continue...?! I don't think so. ********************************* <b> <i> Obstacles are what you see when you set your eyes off the goal.	1

What is the process for getting police report for accidents?	You should call the Traffic Police and inform them about the accident to enable them to see the accident (but dont block the road if it is a minor accident) or both of the vehicles should be taken to the nearest Traffic Departmen. In this case both parties should agree who is responsible for the accident.	1
What is the process for getting police report for accidents?	1) Call 999 if you are on the accident spot! 2) In case the accident is minor and fault is accepted by either one; then you both may directly go to the nearest police station and you will get the report instantly. If third party was NOT involved in the accident & you damaged the car by yourself; you can follow the same procedure # 2 above.	1

What is the process for getting police report for accidents?	I think you need to go to the police station located in the area of the accident. talk to the guy who hit your car; and agree on a time for meeting at the police station.I think both of you should be present at the station. explain the situation; you may need to pay a fee for paper work; and they may call you the following day for the report. Take your id; id copy; istimara; and insurance documents with you. Make sure that you clear any of your earlier radar fines; to get the report.	1
What is the process for getting police report for accidents?	Call that guy ( who hit your car); and tell him that you will meet in the police traffic division- the nearest police traffic division were the accident took place; to whatever time you are both two comfortable of; since the traffic division is 24hrs; except i think there is no office during friday and saturday.. and if as you said the guy is the culprit then he should pay 100 plus 20QR for the report; and you as the victim will also pay 20QR for the report.. after that check with your arabic friend who can read and interpret the report( since the report is typed in arabic); ask them what is the name of the insurer of the car who hit you; and google their contact nos; lastly go directly to their office(insurer) and give them the police report.. and the they will give you the details on what you will do next.. I hope that helps...	1

i have one minibike 49cc.. can i ride in qatar?	I'd guess as with most countries you can drive them on private land (with the owner's permission).

At the end of the day; we all see people on quad bikes with inadequate lights and no protection on the roads here at times; so why not a mini bike? Whether you get away with it will depend on your nationality! I trust you take out life and third party insurance before you start! Mini bikes on public roads in the UK set a bad example for the "real" motorcyclists so it won't be any different here. Your call...	1

Whether ur local or non local or whether u r a muslim or non- muslim; u have to follow the dress code.

Dear all; I wud like to knw how many of u have tried the special K kelloggs Challenge..??was it effective?im skipping 1 meal as per their program to lose sme kgs and instead eating it...has it worked for u??Thanx for sharing ur genuine experiences.....	It can work but the danger is to re-gain the weight once you go back to your normal diet. If you just want to loose a few kilos to get inside a dress why not (but our bodies do not like very much this kind of games :-). For a healthier diet; change your way of eating by taking out the extra (extra quantity; extra sugar and fat) and add the good ones (fruits; vegetables and exercise). You may not loose weight as quickly but it will last. Check your BMI kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) ;decide what BMI you want to reach (to be healthier and/or to fell better) and allow you some time to reach it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index And whatever you do (diet; exercise); you have to enjoy it; if not one day or another you will swap to your old habits :-)	1
Dear all; I wud like to knw how many of u have tried the special K kelloggs Challenge..??was it effective?im skipping 1 meal as per their program to lose sme kgs and instead eating it...has it worked for u??Thanx for sharing ur genuine experiences.....	Don't replace your meal with special K. It is high in sugar and is made from simple white flour. If you insist on eating cereal instead of a normal meal then try eating one that reduces its sugars slowly. i.e. less refined and more complex carbohydrate. Dorset muesli for example with nuts and unprocesses grains. With the simple carbs in special K you will just get an insulin spike and feel hungry soon after. Generally if you want to lose weight then reduce your carbohydrate and increase green vegetables. So less potatoes; rice; pasta and as much green vegetation as you can manage.	1

Many clinics : but which one is good and provides a reliable professional service at sensible prices ?	Best clinic is Queen Clinic; there is a branch in Villagio. The back entrance of Villagio; it's obvious. And there is a branch in City Center; at the parking lot. (Ask about it there). About the prices I don't really know if it's considered expensive or reasonable. My parents are regular clients there; and it's excelllent; with a very well experienced and professional team. The owner of the Clinic is Doctor Mamdouh Fareed. He is the best of all doctors there. Go check it out anyways. Good luck!	1
Many clinics : but which one is good and provides a reliable professional service at sensible prices ?	Doha Dental Complex. Montazah st. right after its junction with C-ring road go to the service road it will be on your right. Dr. AbdelNafe3 elSibaei; one of the very few competent and honest dentists here who will not add extra fake work just for money.	1
Many clinics : but which one is good and provides a reliable professional service at sensible prices ?

HMC has a Smoking Cessation programme (for about 8 weeks). Unfortunately; they are out of stock of the Drug Zyban - and I am stuck half way through; without completing the course of 8 weeks. Side effects are; of course; very horrible; but anybody serious will agree that it is or was worth the troublesome experience. Take an appointment at 44174411 (Gharafa) or 44391177 (HMC).

The issue would be not with your gender but with your visa. Since you're on the visit visa you need to find job/company that will provide with the residence permit before your current visa expires or else a fine of 200QR/day for overstaying. Good Luck!	1

My daughter loves to eat Hamous and Kubus (arabic Bread) can any body tell me whether it is good for her health Thanks.	It is good for growing children but depends how and when it is consumed... Recomendations A) Early B/Fast B) Early Dinners Better to consume with more olive oil (Organic/Extra Virgin; First Cold press) as a topping add on. Two/Three times a week is ok if your staple food is not lentil based. I assume you will be buying it from famous Hamous guys (Beruit); order it without oil and use your own olive oil as recomended above. Hope this helps	1

My daughter loves to eat Hamous and Kubus (arabic Bread) can any body tell me whether it is good for her health Thanks.	This is taken from Wikipedia Nutritional information Lebanese hummus; garnished with whole chickpeas; on a Yemeni serving dish. Hummus is high in iron and vitamin C; and also has significant amounts of folate and vitamin B6.[23] The chickpeas make it a good source of protein and dietary fiber. Depending on the recipe hummus carries varying amounts of monounsaturated fat.Hummus is useful in vegetarian and vegan diets and like other combinations of grains and pulses; when eaten with bread it serves as a complete protein.	1

Some people will get 1 or 2 days off. Some people will get 10 days off. It just depends who you are and whether your manager likes you. There is no hard and fast rule about who will definitely get a certain number of days off.	1

I want to get away for the long weekend but I can't book flights until I know for certain. Thanks;	I agree that is the case in reality. However; Qatari Labour law (Law 14) does make specific provision for Eid Al-Adha holidays. For private sectors workings it states that you should get 3 working days off. If your manager insists on you working those days; then you are entitled to 150% of your salary for those days. I don't want to resight labour law; as these laws are not always adhered to. I just want to know which 3 days this will be this year if your manager just so happens to be a really nice guy and gives you the days off as per the 3 day requirement.	1

Curious ... Can someone tell me if it mentions in the Quran somewhere; Thou shalt close thine restaurant doors at prayer time and not allow thy potential customer entry; but instead leave him sat on the doorstep for 30 minutes in the searing heat to wither away ... but only in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? For this is what just happened to me last night. Yours; Hungry and annoyed of Al Khobar.	for all those people who started to bash baldrick .. Our Prophet "Mohamed" PBUH Said to Omar Ibn el Khatab ... "Do not be rude or stony-hearted or they will go far away from you" If you want to discuss Islam with someone you should be nice .. this is what our REAL Islam told us how to deal with people .. Or else he/she/they will take a bad impression about muslims and ISLAM .. To BaldRick It was clearly mentioned in our Religion that whenever there is a prayer we should leave our life ALL of it behind and rush for it as the prayer is considered to be a call from God .. as if God is inviting you to his home .. so every real muslim will go .. I'm sorry for what happened to u .. but the islam doesn't mean any offense to those who r not muslim .. it expect them to understand our religion and just make little adjust to ur life wherever u go ... When we go to another country we follow their rules .. not ours .. right?? so know the rules & regulations within the country u live in and try to cope with it .. hope i make it clear without any offense to ANYBODY ..	0

Mga KABAYAN help please...Currently I am in Dubai UAE and i got new employer in Qatar..According to them they are in need of my Attested education Certificate...How to do this and exactly what kind of attestation it is? Redribbon from DFA or CHED attestation?	same here; my educ cert was really required for the processing of the work visa. Got my cert attested by the Phil Embassy and after by MOFA here in Doha. But the P.E. can only accept it for attestation if its has red ribbon from DFA and the DFA authentication requires educational cert to be attested by CHED. Long process but it's a must requirements. ;D Might it help to ask your company again whether its ok to do the attestation in Phil Embasssy and MOFA in Dubai? or as what mentioned above; try to inquire P.E. in dubai. If so; would they need the orig copy? because it's kinda a risky to send it via courier unless you personally hand it over to your company..? Hope this helps.	1
Mga KABAYAN help please...Currently I am in Dubai UAE and i got new employer in Qatar..According to them they are in need of my Attested education Certificate...How to do this and exactly what kind of attestation it is? Redribbon from DFA or CHED attestation?	be careful.. do not ever surrender the original red ribboned education certificate stamped by phil embassy & MOFA -qatar... you are required to submit a copy only... make sure you have also copied the stamps from phil embassy & MOFA-qatar...the labor dept of qatar does not require the original... you will only have to show them the original but they will not take it from you...keep the original with you... the red ribboned educ certificate has no expiration contrary to what other filipinos say... remember it's not that easy to get authenticated documents...moreover; you will also need authenticated NBI clearance (red ribboned & stamped by phil embassy & MOFA-qatar).. this time you can surrender the original as the NBI clearance itself is valid only for 1 year...	1

Is it possible to go to Qatar in a non-resident working visa and once I arrived there; then I will start the process of attestation by the Qatar PE and MOFA-Qatar to upgrade my visa to resident visa?	1

So visited store and got s sample curtain ring home which was right size for the curtain rod. Placed order for metal rings with Sedar over phone and in color of my choice. The salesman told e delivery would be to my home in 5 business days and the curtain rings cost me QAR96 for a set of 16 rings in color of my choice. Not bad service though bit pricey. At least I have my curtain problem resolved! Just FYI for anyone out there who finds themselves in similar situation - Sedar does address this request. Thanks Sedar!	0

First of all; there aren't many playgrounds only couple but they are always so crowded and the kids are so agressive you don't even want your kid to go near them; the kids here have no respect and no manner; beside it gets super HOT in summer so even forget about the parks. For sure its better to live in a Villa. I would not recommend living here unless you make some good money to save for your future.	1

Any information would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks!	Hi Alison; I have recently moved to Doha from the UK with a toddler in tow too. My son is going to be 2 in December so theyre roughly the same age. There are plenty of mother & toddler groups and nurseries to choose from. Eventually; youll make friends with little people and be able to socialise with them more often so the children can play together. Speaking from my own experience; my son is extremely happy here. He loves the good weather and he enjoys going swimming everyday too. The heat isnt really an issue; I think the air con is worse to be honest; I'm always cold indoors! I keep my son out of the midday sun and weve been ok so far (touch wood). My hubby is home by 4pm ish everyday; so quality of family life is much better here than the UK. My hubby and son enjoy spending time together here; which wasnt so easily done in the UK. Im currently living in an apartment; because hubbys company has paid for it for 3 months; but were looking for a villa to move into. I agree with the others; a villa in a compound is probably the better option. Anyway; best of luck whatever you decide; feel free to ask any questions.	1
Hi; Any advice for my friend who just confess to me that he is not currently employed to the company that promised him to process his working visa but after 11 months now still no action from the company. Can you guys give us some ideas on what steps we should take. Cause I am thinking of seeking a legal action from the Labor Department or going to a attorney or any other relevant offices to this case. Thank you;	My advice is first try to convince the employer to process your visa as soon as possible. late sallary does not matter. Also inform the employer that you are illegal resident now and will be problem if any emergeny exit required. Also inform the employer with very soft words that if action not taken then you will be left with no option but to consult labor department.	1

But I think Samsung omnia is the best out there as its GPS with Garmin software stands ahead. It also has 5MP camera combined with advantage of Windows.

Which is good for viewing TV channels; LCD TV or Plasma TV. What is the difference between LCD and Plama TVs. Thanks for your answere	<b> present day LCD technology has come to so advance !!! Now LCD comes with more then 50000/1 dynamic ratio also panel comes with 100 Hz Technology. Now LCD is way head of plazma. The link given in earlier answer is 2 years old!!! So it is LCD is better thats why SONY; SAMSUNG and other company makes Few Plazma TV compared to LCD. Also a result of the success of LCDs; the number of plasma manufactures has decreased over the past two years. LCD is WAY AHEAD go for LCD or LED !! So while no technology can be successful forever; plasma has at the very least a few years left; it won't be LCD that will kill it. The only technology that actually seems poised to replace it is OLED!! GO FOR LCD <B>	1

Does anybody know any DICKIES STORE here in Doha?	Have you asked the one who assessed you about your driving skills and where have you failed? Because by asking; you might improve and eradicate those mistakes the next time you would go for a license. When driving always see to it that your eyes are looking on the road and must not look on the shifting gear when you change shift. Because a split second can endanger someone's life or your life. Slow moving vehicles must always use the right lane. When going for an intersection maybe let other cars pass before you continue. I forgot the right of way on whether you should go or stop. I think it's better for the latter so that you can have a safe trip. Also maintain a considerable distance if there's a car in front of you. The distance would be the same as if you would imagine that there's an equal size car in between the two of you. Just in case the front car would go and hit his breaks; you would have the ability not to hit the front car with the distance you just imposed. Hope you would pass next time and kindly tell the one sitting beside you on your next test to tell your mistakes after the result has been given.	0

I advise you to do a triptek but you need a qatari guy to sponsor you...Enjoy your trip :)	1

Is there any way to go there by car without this Qatarian Sponsor for the Triptic??? The car is installed on Commercial Bank. Do i need any thing more Than Saudi Transit Visa??? Please Help	I read this thread while researching the Triptic requirements for my drive from Doha to London. Now that I am back in London I think I can dispel some of the myths. I drove from Doha through Saudi; Jordan; Syria; Turkey; Greece; Italy; Germany and Holland before taking a ferry to the UK. The car had a Qatari number plate. Saudi first; You do not need a Triptic; just a visa (Transit in my case) which is usually valid for 3 days. There is nowhere to buy a Triptic anywhere near the Jordan border. Jordan; There is no need for a Triptic or advance visa. This can be bought at the border along with car insurance. Syria; There is no need for a Triptic. I had a visa from the Syrian Embassy in Doha. Insurance can be bought at the border. Turkey; There is no need for a Triptic. Visa can be bought at the border along with car insurance. Greece; no Triptic requirement; Insurance can be bought at the border and covers the whole EU for one month. Having entered the EU; there are no further visa; insurance or Triptic requirements. Egypt has a Triptic requirement but is a nightmare to drive in. I would recommend leaving the car in Aqaba and taking the ferry to Nuweiba; where coaches operate to Cairo.	1

Does anyone know of any institutions that offer introductory photoshop courses in Doha?	Aptech is a fine choice for introductory photoshop lessons.	1
Does anyone know of any institutions that offer introductory photoshop courses in Doha?	If you have NEVER worked on Photoshop before; the best would be to first get ur hands dirty with online tutorials and get yourself familiar with the menu's and just the basic working of the software. Youtube is the best source. Problem with going for short courses is that they just skim through everything quickly giving u an introduction; showing you what the menus do and other such options nothing useful..all of which you can learn online for free. Once you feel you are good with the basics just enroll yourself for more advanced course where you will fully unleash the power of Photoshop...thats just my opinion for value for money. :P	1
I want to purchase a Abaya. I checked many shops but it is very costly. Around 1000/- to 1500/-. But i dont want to spend that much. Please suggest any shops there i can buy cheap Abaya. Please post the details and cost of Abaya. Thanks	Souq Faleh is the abaya souq. It is on the same road as Souq Jaber; it is closer to the western union. There are about 100 shops in there or more; and you can get readymade or pick a design and they will sticth it for you. You can get a modest abaya for around QR 150 and a more elaborate stich for around 300-400. Abayas in this souq can go for thousands but it depends on how elaborate you want it. Bargain the price; be relentless; if you dont suceed in one shop go to the next. _____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	1

Go in the morning to immigration gate 4 first floor (committee for looking into incomers' applications).

Pls contact me on 688 6924 or 588 5632	I hope this dog has a family looking for him. Sadly in Dukhan we had had 2 retreivers dumped last week; they are very friendly and socialised and obviously used to belong to someone. This is exactly why I get sad by the changing fashions of dog breeds here; this time last year everyone wanted a Golden Retriever. Good luck; I hope you find his owners or a nice home for him.	1

Pls contact me on 688 6924 or 588 5632	Jasmine - that is so sad to hear. Why do people do this ? You are giving your dog a death sentence of slowing starving and dying in a cruel way. These dogs do not know how to fend for themselves.... The dog I found is about 10 years old and has been part of a family. How cold hearted must you be to just dump him and leave. I can not keep him for much longer as I have 4 cats who are so stressed out and living in my bedroom - it;s not fair on them. I will keep him until after New Year incase his family has gone on vacation and the maid does not know where to look. After that he will need to be re-homed. Not sure how to go about it but have already spoken to Kelly at QAWS. She is a star....	1

where can i find Yazbeck Wetsuits? is that brand available in qatar ?? thx a lot	LX so far the only shop where I have seen wetsuits is Go in Villagio Mall; but in the area nearby the Museum of Islamic Art there are two or three stores you might want to check because they sell marine stuff/goods. Also going to Al Wakra there is one store for marine items. When going to AW from Doha; passing the first R/A on your right hand side there is a store for marine items. Do you know where the Lufthansa offices are (Rayyan Complex) there you can find another store that sells maritime stuff. Hope to be helpful!! Regards!!	1

Hi How much does a car like chevy aveo can be had on rental for a year.?Also is there any hidden charges with * terms and conditions ? Who is the best rental company here? thanks rgds sri	LOL!! You guys HAVE to stop renting cars for such long periods. Almost all the instructors in my college had rented cars; some for even 2 years...really really dumb. Even if you dont know the whereabouts in a new country you ARE already posting a question in a website where you can sell your cars. Even if your considerng the lose you'll be facing when selling your car; its still going to be better then just paying the full amount of the car & then just walking away. You'll ATLEAST get half of the price back.	0

You are better off buying a car than renting and just sell it when you are ready to leave Qatar even at a loss you are still saving a bunch and protecting yourself from those " special terms and conditions".	1

The labour law clearly says Eid and Qatar National Day should be working day; so if the holiday falls on Friday this day should carry forward to next working day; if your company working on Saturday it should be Saturday; if Friday-Saturday off should be Sunday; unfortunately some companies are not following any rules which gets any benifits to employees; you work.. work... work... we earn when we feel you dont need simply go.. when you find any good job with better salary can say "No release". sponsorship law should be revised or you dont have any right as a human being; your life is controlled by a company or a sponsor??!!

The best advice that one can give you is to fisrtly - think about what it really is that you want to do in life. What are you good at? If you are unsure... sometimes it helps to see a careers advisor. They are tests that you can take; which identify your strengths and weaknesses; and that can ultimately help you pursuing a career in line with your unique talent. If you don't have anyone you can talk to; e-mail me more details about yourself; and maybe I can direct you a little ;o) bebeuk@gmail.com	1

Hi; you can take 42" LCD TV;but its total weight with box must be less than 32kg and size as per airport rules and price should be less than 25000 IRS;so that you will not pay customs.If the TV is bought recently than its possible because all new;and latest models are slim and weighing less;I took one to India recently in month of July. bye	1

Hi; I plan to go Dubai with family (2 adults and 1 baby)for holiday on May. can anyone please recommend a good and reasonable price of hotel or apartment in Dubai? Preferably close to Emirates Mall.. Convenience. Budget about 200-400QR per night. Thank you.	Try Millenium airport hotel; it is 5 minutes from the airport and 500 meters from GIGICO metro station. I paid around 400 Ryials per night for a double room through Expedia.com The hotel is 4 stars with nice and spacious rooms and good service. And one piece of advice; use the metro; it is cheap; reliable and will take you to all interest points including Emirates mall and Mall of Dubai. Have a nice trip and let me know if you need other info	1

Convenience. Budget about 200-400QR per night. Thank you.	That would be a 2-3 star hotel. MOE (Mall of Emirates)is accessible if you're going by Dubai Metro. I would suggest that you stay near Deira City (rather than on that area if you plan to stroll around). You'll have more access to malls like Deira City Center; Dubai Mall (near tall Burj Khalifa and the awesome water fountain)and Creek Park (Dolphinarium etc...) and not really far from the airport... Suggestions that would fit your budget (That I know): Deira City Center Hotel; City Seasons Hotel; Ibis Deira City Center; Novotel Hotel.	1

Heard a rumour that WAC has closed down. Is it true? Anyone know why? Seems a shame to close down one of the very few places of culture to be found in Qatar. Perhaps they need the space for another coffee chain outlet.	Dunno when. Seen it mentioned by two different sources over he last few days. I only eat French KitKats now - Le ChitChat.	1

I'm sure that Doha is like Dubai in the sense that there are bound to be a ton of Starbucks all over the place. My question though.. is which one is the best for socializing? Where I'm from in Texas the Starbucks I most frequented there was always a ton of people that you could randomly sit down with and have a chat. Is there any place like that here... other than a bar.

Thats what I mean... if people in qatar cant handle that... i guess i have 3 things in store for me... a gym... a book... and xbox... though i admit dont have one; but if i cant be randomly social... video games seems the way to go... hahaha ryan	0

Atleast here in Doha... coffee is still rockin' though so its an in-an-out thing... Columbiano Coffee on CRing by Chili's is actually pretty decent. I frequently plop myself down outside or on the nice comfy chairs and have coffee and a bit of lunch and internet surf... great in the evenings after gym anyway (Al Massa is right behind) or on Saturdays. Ive struck up a few conversations here and there and ran into quite a few expats doing the same. Good luck Brin	1

You may have to initiate the conversation; but many people will jump in if you start it. Trust me; the endless coffee shops are thriving everywhere; Starbucks; included.

I dont know about you all... but i dont think toyota knows the meaning of big... nor do my british colleagues that I work with. A real truck is the kind in which you need a step latter to get into. hahaha GYMs.... ok... because ive been working so much i have eaten an abundant amount of crap. ie mcdonalds; burger king; etc... i think ive eaten more fast food in the past month than i have in the past 2 years... anyway... are there any good gyms to work out at there? by good.. i mean; im used to a 24 hour fitness type; in which the gym is huge... not a hotel fitness room. On a personal note... I dont have a truck back home... I have dodge charger... and if i were to get a truckish type vehicle.. id go for a hummer... even though they are most likely going out of business Ryan	0

Ryan	Loathe as I am to make generalization; I disagree Bahraini. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES; people are not as friendly to strangers in Qatar. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - they smile much less. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - people here are obnoxious; disrespectful to service staff in cafes; restaurants; shops; disrespectful of queues; non-smoking signs; use of mobile phones in cinames; and children here; particularly Arab kids; are the rudest little brats I've ever seen. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - no; they are on the whole not friendly to strangers. Try living in a western country and you'll see the difference. People form orderly queues in traffic; at the movies; in shops; everywhere. They don't smoke indoors. They say please and thank you.	0

Ryan	PM - Is Ramada Signal where the GMC garage is? And the Starbucks is next door to Johhny Rockets? Ryan - If the answer to the above question is yes; then I would say this is a good place to start. I am from the UK and everytime we drive past that Starbucks its always fairly busy - no jam packed; but busy enough; and I always say to my husband "lets stop there for a coffee". We have gone there a couple of times and although I have only been here just over 2 weeks; I think it will be my new hangout. Just listen to conversations and you can pick out the english speakers from the none english speakers - although I havent noticed anyone reading books here yet; which is a shame...maybe me and you could start a trend! :) In our old flat in the UK we used to have a Starbucks just a 5 minute walking distance away and I used to go there so regularly that I became pally with the staff and if I wasnt always in a rush; I would have probably made a few friends as well. I am like you; I always want to strike up a conversation with randoms because people interest me and I believe that you never know who you are going to meet. At the end of the day; dont let this thread scare you off meeting people - ok; if they are wearing abayas; perhaps not; but I have found when you speak to people here; they are usually very friendly; more friendly than Dubai even! (I have never been to Texas so can't comment on that neck of the woods!)	1

Try to recollect the events and your standard practice of driving in the past few days that some traffic police man is hiding such a way that u would have not noticed and they will take note of irregularities such as speaking in mobiles; non tightning seatbelts;such and such is like that and will be recorded in their system and message may be automated subsequently to appear in ur mobile on this particular day. If u are very much sure; just try madeenat khalifa and ask for evidences convincing the situation as you believe now that you have not moved out the car on this particular day. Good luck	1

Opening up an internet cafe is viable only at certain locations .....well if u have identified one..kewl But to make it more viable you can really add on value added services...++ much much more...

Hi Everyone; My friends who are both married to each other would like to visit me in Qatar. We were planning for them to stay with me. I am a single man with two bedrooms. Is it acceptable for them to stay in the other bedroom or would that be against Muslim laws?	You have'nt mention about your friends...are they muslims? I don't think so any one should have objection on it.. They are not only ur friends they r ur guest too so give them respect.	0

There is however always the possibility of some narrrow minded person making an objection. This would invariably be a fellow expat who wishes to make a statement in an attempt to draw attention to him/herself. 99.9% safe.	1

I have an impt question and need expert feedback. If the last day of annual leave is immediately followed by 3 days of Eid holidays; Are these 3 days considered as part of annual leave? In my company the HR Dept. calculates the 3 days as extension of annual leave and hence leave without pay. Is this correct as per the law? Experts pls guide.	NO; its a public holiday. So you have get paid for that.	1

In my company the HR Dept. calculates the 3 days as extension of annual leave and hence leave without pay. Is this correct as per the law?

The worker shall be entitled to annually; leave with full wage as follows: 1.Three working days for Eid EI-Fitr 2.Three working days for Eid Al-Adha 3.One working day for the Independence day 4. Three working days to be specified by the employer.	1

Not all companies fall under the labour law troll; you work in the ministry you should know that. QP; RasGas; Al Jazeera etc and the rest of the government are not governed by the labour law; they are governed by their own policy with civil law be the deciding factor. If you are on leave during a holiday; that day is counted as your annual leave. If you return from leave and resume work for one day prior to the Eid holiday then it will not be counted as annual leave. Same goes for maternity leave. Annual leave is paid leave and an public holidays that fall within it are not counted as extra days unless your company has specific policy in this regard. ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	1

Can anyone recommend a good Turkey tour travel agent or tour package? David	No need for a travel agent for tours. Just book the cheapest flight and go directly to Sultanamet in Istanbul. All the sights are conveniently located in that area and there are dozens of hotels that you can chose there and then. We just used the map and walked everywhere!!! Yeh we didnt need to waste money on taxis or othe transport. Let me warn you that mid June and Jult gets very hot and humid but the monuments are certainly worth it. We even walked to the Bosporous from our hotel (Hotel Ambassador) and bought the ticket there and then; for the boat ride so no need to spend extra by buying the ticket from a tour operator. Istanbul is beautiful and the kids and i loved it. Cant wait to go back.	0
Can anyone recommend a good Turkey tour travel agent or tour package? David	Lamea has given you excellent advise. We had a lovely trip 2 years back. All major attractions are walking distance in Sultan Ahmet. We spent 3 days in Istanbul; then took a tour from one of the local tour operators and spent 12 days exploring Cappadokia; Pammukale; Kusa desi; Troy etc. It was great ... we learnt a lot about history; did a lot of trekking; me; my wife & 3 kids loved the tour. The 12 days trip costed me 1000 euros and about 500 in istanbul. Call me if u need more info ... Cheers Zak (6646-8056)	0
Can anyone recommend a good Turkey tour travel agent or tour package? David	Wow.. Thank you everyone. Yes; actually my plan is to travel and explore Istanbul by ourself and get a local tour for trip to Cappadocia and Pamukkale. Or is it a good idea to travel to Cappadocia and Pamukkale without tour guide as well?? We will be travel to Turkey on end of September. I believe the weather is nice on that month.	0
Can anyone recommend a good Turkey tour travel agent or tour package? David	Turkey is a mountain country; so travel by train and coach is slow ... i bought the package from a local tour operator in istanbul (sultan Ahmet area). All tour operators give u the same package i.e. the hotel accomo is same ... but the ones on the main street are twice expensive compared to the ones in side streets. We took a luxury coach from istanbul at night and arrived early morning in capadokia... then took coach to pammukale (6hrs)... It was comfortable and pleasant ... you can research about turkey on the internet. You dont need a translator... the tour operator will give u the itinerary for your trip and when u arrive at hotel they tour guide will collect you and they speak good english. When u are in capadokia PLEASE take the Hot air Baloon Safari... its a great experience to see the chimneys from above ... leave the kids in the hotel because its expensive. Cheers	1

Hey guys! Can anyone tell me the price of a pack of Marlboro (or similar) cigarrettes in Doha? Thank you very much!	"Smoking is responsible for several diseases; such as cancer; long-term (chronic) respiratory diseases; and heart disease; as well as premature death. Over 440;000 people in the USA and 100;000 in the UK die because of smoking each year. According the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention); $92 billion are lost each year from lost productivity resulting from smoking-related deaths. Of the more than 2.4 million deaths in the USA annually; over 440;000 are caused by smoking. Smoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the world.

I have a 2.5 years old son with a delay in speech. I wonder this is a sign of autism. Is there a doctor in doha who can help me. Please help me.	Speech delay alone is not a sign of autism. There are other signs. I would highly recommend that you go to Shafalllah Centre for an assessment; and if he is diagnosed there as autistic or just speech delay; you can go to Qatar Autism Centre for private one-to-one sessions; but this depends on your budget; Rumaila's problem is that they have very busy schedules and they give you only one session per week and they depend on the parents to continue at home but they are supported by Hamad so you do not pay a lot for this session. But in Qatar Autism Centre; it is not supported but they can give you up to 3 times a week and during the evening and not during working hours as in Rumaila! Good Luck!	1

As to whether or not the spec of the car is suitable to be driven in Qatar without modifications to AC etc; I shall find out when I call Mercedes; tomorrow. I know that a lot of the specs are above GCC specs (i.e. emissions; airbags; safety rating etc). However; if bringing the car over is simply a legal impossibility; then I'll save my time. <b>That</b> is the purpose of my question. So; I ask again; can I bring it over; and if so; how? Given the credit crunch; it is impossible to sell for a reasonable return; so I'd rather keep it out here. Thanks	0
I'm planning on shipping (or driving over) my RHD UK car to Qatar for the duration of my contract. I'll be taking it back to UK at the end of the contract. The car is only 2 years old.

I'm in Doha now so please advice me where I can go to arrange this. Regards; ys	Why not just store it? Then you have a nice car to come home to... You can't teach experience...	0

There is a very nice moulinex one that has attachements for chopping and grinding but it runs about 600+Qr; but very handy.

Thanks in advance.	hi! i have break outs a few months back; no doubt exacerbated by the weather; dust and food here. before; i used to have few pimples but it was hormonal (i only have pimples after college already)so my ob-gyn prescribed a low dose birth control pills for me (diane). it worked actually but since i don't want to be under medication on anything for a long time; i stopped taking the meds. i tried lots of over the counter products but not all of them worked as advertised. now;i'm using st. ive's facial scrub (gentle); followed by an exfolliant/ lightening product (extraderm-a filipino product) then moisturizer (olay complete). thank fully; the break outs subsided. i guess; you have to use gentle products and stick with them if you are okay with them.(i have used clearasil before but it is not effective on my skin) then stay away from fried food esp. chicken and dusty places. i had a major breakout when i was still living in gharaffa which is very; very dusty. if you want first aid (when you have to go on dates or impt. functions) do these steps: 1. clean face 2. put ice on the pimple for about 10-20 mins. this will lessen the swelling. 3. dip a piece of cotton on fresh lemon juice then placed it atop the pimple for about 5 mins. this will lessen the redness. feel free to pm me if you have further questions..	1

Please help. I have pimples and spots from pimples; what can I use; and were do I get the product? Thanks in advance.	Rein A is effective but first you have to find something to peel the outer part of your skin...this will make any over the counter cream effective. Maxi peel is used for at least a month but avoid sun while using; better yet use only at night; and lots of moisturizers and sunblock in the day. Peeling of the skin is good so as to take out all old skin where dirt hides and and when infection occurs; it freaks out there the pimples cause. But after few weeks of peeling; you can then proceed to retin- A for complete medication. Chocolates or sweets or fries is not really the cause; but makes the pimples big it triggers to be big; itchy; red;and swell. Avoid spicy too; drinking citrus juice helps to shrink them. If this pimples really big and all over your face and even at your back; better consult the doctor to take medicine intake; i forgot the name; but i will get back to you soon i remember	1

If he doesn't cancel his Saudi visa it will automatically expire 6 months after his departure and then the ban time starts. If his visa is cancelled by his employer it goes straight into ban period (however long that is in Saudi). Suggestion? Get a new passport to reenter another GCC Country. Have met many people during my stay in Qatar who have done the same.	1

I had a couple of guys in our company who were banned (not only cancelled) in UAE and they got their Qatari work visa with the same passport. Only in some specific cases; the ban is imposed in all the GCC...not in all. As far as the dual GCC residency is concerned..... I dont know about all the GCC but Qatar allows you to keep both by paying a fee of QR 2000/year. The information is available on the MoI's website.	1

Hey guys is there anywhere (preferably where I can have a beer!) I can watch the England v West Indies cricket game? I was thinking Champions in the Marriott but its not actually a very nice bar in my opinion. Any other hotels or one of the few licensed bars? Cheers	Ramada Sports Bar	1

I was thinking Champions in the Marriott but its not actually a very nice bar in my opinion. Any other hotels or one of the few licensed bars? Cheers	Thanks Luciano! I must admit; I didn't make it to the Ramada and did (sadly) end up in Champions. The big problem with Champions was the lack of sound as I like hearing the commentary. Are we able to hear the commentary in Ramada? If not then I guess I will watch it in my hotel room. I won't be able to have a beer but I will at least really enjoy the cricket.	0

Movenpick Towers is too slow to run anything useful. Just about get away with TVCatchup but forget iPlayer; 4OD; Sky Go/Player... need too much bandwidth. :(	1

Cheers	I'll be staying in the Asas Twin Towers Apartments in West Bay. Obviously I've not idea what they have there! If the internet is too slow then it'll have to be the pub for any sport until I sort my own place out when the wife comes over at the end of summer.	0

I was thinking Champions in the Marriott but its not actually a very nice bar in my opinion. Any other hotels or one of the few licensed bars? Cheers	OK; so you shouldn't be too far from the Marriott then which will at the very least; cover the usual selection of sports. Failing that; you also have the option of the Ramada but that's a bit further out of town (5 each way in a cab). I personally am not a big fan of Champions (the Marriott) but I will if I have to. Also; as these pubs show many different sports they rarely put the sound on.... although they did for the footy the other night. Of course; another option would be to go sit in champions with your laptop; stick your headphoness; tag on to the free wifi; fire up the VPN and order a beer... ;)	1

I'll be looking for somewhere decent to go for the Euros; especially the England games. Will be over after our first game. Once I get my permanent place I'll sort out my sports based TV package!	0

If any body know about any car less than 1000 riyal for rental;please answer me.	the cheapest rate we had the last time we rented a car was for Qr60 per day; Honda Civic 2005.

Hi; Just happened to read on msn health that one of the 14 kitchen gadgets required for any " healthy kitchen" is the Good Grips Salad Chopper with bowl. Does any one know if this is available in Doha - if so where ? WE do so love salad at home but are often deterred by not being able to chop the leaves into teeny weeny bits. AP	I dont think you will find it; but there is a herb chopper here. It is basically a rounded 2 blade knife which is rocked back and forth over the leaves to make them this way. You should be able to find it in Lulu quite easily; or any supermarket for that matter. ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	1

AP	All you need guys is a good knife and chopping board. Regarding tabboule. Nothing will do but chopping the parsley by hand (knife/board). Even if you manage to chop the parsley ; you are stuck with cutting the tomatoes. They have to be cut into 5 to 10mm cubes. My information about healthy salad; is to chop the green leaves and herbs by hand (no knife) The funny thing when they say "This gadget strips lemons and oranges of their outermost peels; which contain limonene; a compound that may decrease cancer risk." and somewhere else thay talk about a can opener. When cans are involved; cancer is there. ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409	0

AP	Canned food might include many preservatives; additives; flavors; colorings. Most are not natural products. Rather artificial. I am talking about the Eeeee's family. I am not sure if there are any studies in this regard. But there are warnings about additives. Check the ingredients and do some research about the E-family. Here is a link to start with http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm In my opinion. A nice presentation has nothing to do with the way you prepare food. For example salad is usually a cocktail of vegetables; possibly some fruits; possibly cheese and ham. You can simply mamage a nice decoration for the top part and forget about the lower part. If you watch how Jamie Oliver prepares the food; you will be amazed. In no time he can prepare food and arrange a table with a nice variety and it looks yummy ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409	1

How would you rate medical services here in Qatar?	For the budget they have; one can send all HMC patients to Mayo Clinic and still have more money left. JCI is a management accreditation; not quality. HMC dares to publish a survey showing how many of their top staff; or their families; actually use the service of HMC.	1

How would you rate medical services here in Qatar?	JCi is a very good accrediting body which provides correct tools and solutions to any healthcare organization. Proper or Actual use of those tools rests at the hands of the staff. 1. Implementation is such a different issue. that depends on the staffs' intellect; willingness to adapt new processes; as well as their genuine service; not to mention that they should have real educations; not fake ones.	1

JCI is directing all departments for the right procedures and policies.to be honest if JCI is not visiting; there are enough staff just neglecting their work. that can be seen just before jci visit; their running everywhere. don't know what to do.coz they were not working.if we do daily updates and follow procedures ccomplete our day-to-day work and responsibilities; we don't have to scared of jci.what i noticed so many departments;heads are panic and updating everything only just before jci visit. i am really happy to have jci visit every month.	1

Hi How and where from can I get the International Driving License. I am possessing the Qatari Driving License. How quick I can get and how much it costs. I want to use this IDL in countries of Europe; Cananda and USA.	First the international Driving License is not a Driving License; Just a translation of your DL in several languages and should be provided by an official authority not by any web-based agency. Second; this does not replace your DL; and you have to keep both documents with you. Third; the Qatar DL is NOT recognised in many countries; I just checked in France and Belgium and this is not the case at the moment. So check before for every country you plan to visit; since in several countries you will not be allowed to drive. Generally speaking it seems that it works with reciprocity; nationalities that have to pass the driving test here come from countries that do not recognize the Qatari driving license. This might chance since it seems that obtaining the DL here is getting harder.	1

Anyone has some ideas in Doha? Thanks	State of Qatar doesn't allow practice of Homeopathy; tough luck.	1
Anyone has some ideas in Doha? Thanks	That might not be the case flexicode. From what I've heard there are places here that do provide forms of natural/alternative medicine; which they call here 'ilaaj tabee-ee'. I know that the Boots store in uk stock homeopathic remedies but I'm not quite sure about the Boots here; but its still worth continuing to ask around or when in doubt call up 180 and ask if they have any numbers for places that practice natural medicine or homeopathy.	1
Anyone has some ideas in Doha? Thanks	uk_qtr; the practice of homeopathy is prohibited here by law; but if somebody is practicing it under a different name; I don't know. However I will be happy to find a good homeopathy practitioner in Qatar myself. Lets find it and whosoever comes across one; will inform the other. I will be working on your 'ilaaj tabee-ee' clue.:)	1
Anyone has some ideas in Doha? Thanks	Thanks guys; well actually; cant understand why its forbidden in Qatar; I need homeopathic remedies for myself and my allergies; otherwise I would have to take commercial medicines which are heavy in side effects. Homeopathy is just great; a little plant can make miracles. If you do find out; please post it on the forum again. Thanks -	0

What is considered a good package in Qatar? I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport. Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	that is more or less QAR6.5K. i think that's a bit low; but if they pay for your accom and schooling for your kids (your two biggest expenses);you could be making some saving...maybe just get them to specify the nature of the perks; i.e. accom=flat or villa; transport= ?. also; do they provide you with return tickets per year for you and your family? hope this helps.	1

The female sex ratio on the contrary is low to very low in old Doha area and in the out side urban areas. Exceptionally; the industrial area of Zone 57 has just 3 females per 1000 of males.

What is considered a good package in Qatar? I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport. Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	The only way to determine if it's a decent package is to try and assess your living costs and determine how much you would be able to save. That's what the majority of people are in Qatar for....to save. It's difficult to fix on a salary as there are so many extras (as others have mentioned) such as education allowance for kids; housing; transport; possibly a furnishing grant etc.	1
What is considered a good package in Qatar? I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport. Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	Prada; Package is fine in itself; it combines all major costs; hence you will be able to set aside little. But you will not be living like a king. If your salary back home is equal; stay away. If this is a major improvement ... why not.	1
What is considered a good package in Qatar? I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport. Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	Thanks for the replies .... now we're getting somewhere hehe. We're a family of three. They will also cover schooling; which is great; since we have a 2 yr old. I think it's okay; since they will cover all major costs. At the moment; we're looking at saving about 2000QAR. DH will also have to find a job once we are there. I have requested a detailed breakdown of all the extra's they will be covering; so I'm waiting to hear back from them. If they cover all major expenses (housing; schooling; transport; relocation; medical) ... 6400QAR + DH's salary are not to bad (I think).	0
What is considered a good package in Qatar? I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport. Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	Prada; do NOT come for less than you are making in the US. The standard recruitment package for Americans is your current salary plus 25% overseas benefit plus housing; transportation; tickets; medical and schooling for up to three children. You're being low-balled; honey; negotiate for more! You won't have the chance later; believe me. Mandi	1

Can anyone tell me the price range of studio apartments in towers in West Bay cost? I'm going to start working in one of them and would like to live near work if possible.	In west bay?

Can anyone tell me the price range of studio apartments in towers in West Bay cost? I'm going to start working in one of them and would like to live near work if possible.	Mandi; originally Ezdan was built as a Hotel; then they re-built it as residential appartements.. I guess they left few smallest appartments without the kitchen as a hotel room.. the layout of the flats sucks (some flats built in a way that you have to cross the bedroom to get into the kitchen); quality sucks; and it's already feels old and stinky... Since they rent out some apartments for the short term like a hotel; you can imagine what's going in the lobby every day...people with the luggage; coming; leaving.. Quite depressing place. I could recommend it as a temporary accommodation in the West Bay for those who just came in Qatar; has a workplace in West bay and is intending to look for the place to live at the same area..	1

Family Visit Visa for my wife and son is approved as per MOI website. What's next?where to get the original printed visa? I'm from Phil. Any kabayan out there...pls help. They say visa should be stamp from Qatar embassy in the Phil and should have also letter from sponsor(me).And how about the ticket?is the dummy ticket(return) is still valid in the Phil?	You can do the following exercise for Family Visa Step by Step 1. Print out the visa and sent to them via e-mail 2. On the original passport insert the Visa copy; NBI copy; 2 x 2 Picture white background 3. Advice them to go to nearest DHL office in your area 4. they will pay 2500 Pesos for DHL charges 5. Wait for 7 working days they sent you SMS for collecting the passport from DHL office. 6. after you receive the original passport from DHL verify the Visa Stamp in the passport. if ok then go through Travel Agency and book them according to your wish. They have 3 months validity to enter Qatar. 7. In immigration they will ask so many question but if you tell them that your husband or wife is an Engineer they will not think twice they will stamp quickly and say ok. Welcome to Qatar	1

Hi Guys! I am under my father sponsorship and will be having my work. The company told me to have my educational certificates translated to Arabic. So I went to Asia Services in Sofitel and got it translated. When I hand it to our HR; she said to have it stamped first by our embassy and MOFA. My question is; what documents should be stamped; the original one or the translated one? Thanks in Advance :)	The originals will need to be attested / stamped.	1

Does anyone know if the rents will go higher in 2013?	What do you mean official? Any reports are only guesswork. Yes; some landlords are putting their rents up because there's a demand on certain properties in the market. Anything that's popular and decent quality will probably see a year on year raise...if you don't like it; they just rent to the next person. On average though; there really shouldn't be a raise!	1

Mums please suggest...........	it varies no 2 babies are alike. You need to ask your doctor and trust your instincts as a mother.	0
Mums please suggest...........	Dear lauraferns; I'd suggest you to watch your baby's growth closely and at some time around 4-6 months ; you may notice that your baby is not getting enough from your milk. ( This is purely subjective but you are the best person to make the decision). At this stage; you can start a little (spoonfuls ) of rice water; egg yolk; a few squirts of orange juice etc..; in the beginning and if you find that everything is going well ; then you can introduce some more new items- one a week or so. Gradually you will find that your baby is enjoying all these new foods. Remember to keep up with the breast milk as long as possible along with these weaning foods. If you would like to include cereal ; you could do that too. By 1 year of age the infant should have had a taste of everything you ever want him/her to. I would advise you not to add sugar or salt additionally in any food item because you may be introducing an unwanted habit for life. Good luck with the weaning. AP	1
Mums please suggest...........	No 2 babies are alike.Check with your doctor. I started semi solid for my kid after 6 months and solids after a year..	1
Mums please suggest...........	From what I've been told and have read... it's best to wait until six months for most babies (always check with the baby's doctor). This is a great website that I used often for food recommendations for babies: http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/ They also have great information on what foods to avoid until the baby is older. Good eating to you baby!	0
Mums please suggest...........	Best age to introduce semi solids is when the baby is 6 months old. Do not introduce salt and sugar to baby's meals untill he/ she is 1 year.	1

Is there anyway to avoid the requirement of a NOC if you want to change a job and your employer does not want to give you a NOC?	For what I have read in the site; yes there is a way. Since your current sponsor/employer does not want to give release/NOC then move back to your country; wait for 2 years and then come back. Sorry but if you can not get NOC then the most likely situation is for you to go back home. Regards!!	1
Is there anyway to avoid the requirement of a NOC if you want to change a job and your employer does not want to give you a NOC?

i would like to travel to uae this eid viaroad. do any body know wether there are sufficiant petrol pumps at the border. how many pumps are there during transit in saudiarabia? thank u in advance	OK here is my advice. fill in Qatar before you leave then fill up again just when you are leaving the Saudi Boarder; this will be the Saudi side before the UAE boarder. This should be enough for to get to Abu Dhabi or even Dubai. Because if you miss this Petrol Station then the next station within in UAE is atleast 100km. This is from my experience of 2007; I dont know if they have built any more Petrol Station since then. Also a small factor to consider is that Petrol in Qatar and Saudi is cheaper than UAE. Have a safe trip.	1

i would like to travel to uae this eid viaroad. do any body know wether there are sufficiant petrol pumps at the border. how many pumps are there during transit in saudiarabia? thank u in advance	There is a petrol station less than a kilometer after going thru the saudi border from qatar (right side). There is another one a few kilometers before exiting saudi to the UAE (left side). There is a petrol station a few kilometers after passing thru the UAE border (right side). This is the last petrol station along the highway before reaching abu dhabi proper. Keep in mind the petrol price in UAE is 3x compared to saudi. I hope this helps. Have safe trip.	1

When I came for my first job in Qatar; 3 years ago; I was never asked to produce a Police Clearance. Would appreciate any clarification on the rules regarding this. Thanks.	A Police Clearance Certificate (PCC)from your country of citizenship is mandatory during sponsorship transfer. At the Indian embassy; the PCC (for Indian Nationals) will be issued within 2 days. Need to fill up the form and 2 photos and around 80 QR. This PCC then needs to be stamped at the Ministry of Consulate Affairs (this is the same MOFA but they've shifted and renamed this section; the building is on your right when traveling from Munthaza signal (Radwat Khalil intersection) to Gulf Cinema signals. This document then needs to be submitted to your new sponsor; they will get a medical date for you (yes; it needs to be done; even if you've done it before for the previous employer). When the medical result and PCC is submitted to the CID; you'll go for fingerprinting and then in 2 weeks CID will either approve or deny the sponsorship change. If the sponsorship change is approved; they will give you / your sponsor your Qatar PCC. End of procedure. Enjoy new job :-)	1

Hi All;;;; I might be traveling to Australia. Anyone here been there and want to share their experiences? Anyone from there to share the secrets of a great time? Hope to get a good response.	Yes; I visited Australia this year in April. It was fun there. I visited Sydney and Melbourne. In Sydney; I visited Opera house; Sydney tower; Sydney harbor; Darling Harbour; Botanic Gardens; Blue Mountains; three sisters and Jenolan caves. All are must visit places. In Melbourne; I visited Great Ocean Road; 12 Apostles; Warnambool; Ballarat; Gippsland lakes; Penguin Island; Yarra forests; Melbourne city; Crown Casino. Remember; I am talking about only one city and state Victoria.. Whole Australia is a tourist place.... I couldn't go to Gold Coast but Insha Allah next time I will go there first. People are very nice and cooperative; we didn't see any racism and rudeness stuff. Regarding shopping; Australia is little bit expensive but DFOs are reasonable. Now a days there will be winter over there. Sydney has pleasant weather but there are four seasons in a day at Melbourne. Winds are very chilled in Melbourne. If you find time; travel between Sydney to Melbourne or vice versa by road. I missed it but I heard it is fun. Have a nice trip!!! If there is any further information needed; let me know.	1

In case of Koalas; I touched it and spend some time with Koalas in Sydney Wild life but I had decided that I will see Kangroos live on roads or in jungles... and atlast I have seen them in Gipsland...

Stay in a Motor inn run as a Family Business. Then proceed to Bowral. Home of Sir Donald Bradman. This is the part of rich people live once they retired.

Your phone should have come with a disk to install on your computer. There should be several phone shops out there that carry or sell the usb cable to connect your phone to your PC.

Please tell me any bicycle repairing shops or persons in the surroundings of Doha.. Thanks in Advance	Hi there; There are many Bicycle repairing/servicing shops in Doha. The one I used to go is behind Souq Najada. Direction to reach there - if you are coming from crazy signal or Toyota signal towards Bank Street; take a left from the signal in front of CBQ; then take right (behind CBQ); go straight; take a left turn when you reach next intersection; towards end of the road; before entering the next intersection; you have a bycicle shop (opposite Qtel entrance of Souq Najada). You may have to park your car in the underground parking - QR 1 riyal). Second option - Electricity Street; opposite Bombay Silk Centre/on the same line with Dulhan.	1

Is it hard to find US measure cookbooks?	Ziplock bags; chocolate chips and pie pans you can get here in almost all the shops (definitely Shoprite & Megamart). Canned pumpkin - sorry don't eat it but they seem to sell every other kind of canned product here! Cookbooks and books - Loads of places to buy books here so don't worry. A lot of people organise book swaps and the best place to buy them are all the table top sales! Diet root beer - can't help you on that one but Shoprite seem to sell a lot of american brand drinks but they are quite pricey. I would be really careful bringing them over though in case they leak etc. www.qaws.org	1

Is it hard to find US measure cookbooks?	Canned pumpkin is sometimes available at MegaMart; but if you want some for this Thanksgiving then I would bring it with you just to be sure. I did bring a HEAP of ziplocs with me from the U.S. They're pricey here and I have only found the good freezer bags at MegaMart for $$$. Seriously; I went to Costco and purchased a couple of packs of the Gallon and a couple of the quart. Haven't regretted it yet. . .BUT. . .I also had a 40' container and almost no furniture so it was a no-brainer for me. You can get chocolate chips here; but in the event that you're a chocolate connoisseur don't count on the good stuff. The waxy-tasting Nestle is about as good as you'll get for chocolate chips.	1

Is it hard to find US measure cookbooks?	Fresh? I find very little of our produce to fall under the category of what I would call "fresh" ;) Yes; bring some canned pumpkin just in case MegaMart runs out. You can find regular ol' ziplocs or generic ziploc-types .. .but the freezer bags that really hold up are not readily available unless you pay $$ at MegaMart. (That said; I haven't tried Shoprite.)	0

Is it hard to find US measure cookbooks?	all 5 Thanksgivings I have had here. Just don't wait until the last minute and you'll be fine. I still have 3 cans from last year in fact. I can buy freezer bags practically anywhere. Decent choc chips come and go. Just stock up when they are here and put them in your freezer. I do buy cookbooks in the US each summer; only have found British ones here (besides the US current best sellers--which are expensive!) Diet root beer can also be found--sometimes. I tried to find a pie pan all last year and know they NEVER had a proper one at the grocery stores. I bought a new pie pan in the US this summer. My advice: don't bring food. My employer didn't allow it anyway; and most don't.	0

i am renting a room in a shared 4 bedroom flat. the person who signed the contract for the flat does not live with us (only comes at month end to collect rent payments). is this legal in qatar rent law?	Bleu; Most properties are actual sublets by agents; if you read my answer again; you will understand what I am talking about; as long as the sublet is done legally meaning with a contract between the Agent/Landlord and the tennant it is legal. Subletting doesn't only mean renting out a property that was rented from an agent without a contract. these are facts.	1

How can i apply a canadian visit visa from Qatar; Advice me please	you need an invitation letter from a sponsor in Canada. That person should be earning a stipulated amount of salary. You should have enough financial transactions in your account for a period of minimum 1 year. You should provide them with proof as to why you will return back to the country like you are having a job here or you are studying here... Then go to the high commission.	1

There are now two data centres in Doha. One run by Qtel; the other by Meeza; which is part of QF. I just don't know the reason why any non-governmental website would host in either of them. I know that before QL switched to RimuHosting; they were paying $100 a month for hosting. Now; I'm sure they're paying more; but not huge amounts more. Both Qtel and Meeza are never going to be able to compete on price. Nor are they going to be able to compete on support. QL is number-three in the top-10 websites in Qatar; and it runs on free software. <a href="http://www.qatarliving.com/user/kutch">Kutch</a> does a great job of running the local free-software group; but there just aren't the numbers of Linux experts in Qatar to be able to provide good support services. The other reason you might not want to host in Qatar is the local legal framework. Hosting in the USA is sometimes frustrating if you receive a barrage of DMCA takedown notices; but at least the law is well-documented. Here; you can't be sure that someone with a bit of wasta wouldn't make a phone call to Qtel and shut you down. Of course; there might be a technical reason to host here. If you needed low latency. Maybe the data centres are full of companies' file servers? However; even if I was running an system that require a low ping; surely it's a safer bet to host in Dubai? Any examples of locally hosted websites???	1

Hello Guys; Can anyone help me find a copy of governing rules regarding house rent increase here in Doha? Some says it should be 10% maximum; but if a sharing accomodation asked an increase of 25%; do you think it's still legal? how and where can a complaint regarding this unjust practices be made?? thanks in advance :)	No governing rules will work here practically. If the landlord wants to increase the rent he can create any reason to send you out from his property. Now no need to worry about the increse in rent. Rent is coming down drastically. Change the house	1

Some says it should be 10% maximum; but if a sharing accomodation asked an increase of 25%; do you think it's still legal? how and where can a complaint regarding this unjust practices be made?? thanks in advance :)	If you have a written contract with the owner; and this contract is signed on or after 01/01/2005 then he has NO RIGHT to increase your rent up to 14/02/2010 as per the law. If the contract is signed before 01/01/2005 then an increase shall occur as per the following table: -rent amount less than QR 2000>>>20% -rent amount between 2000-5000>>>15% -rent amount between 5000-10000>>10% -rent amount more than 10000>>>>>5% In addition he can not kick u out UNLESS you did not pay the monthly rent; or if you rent the flat to others; or if he want to use the appartment by him or his family mambers; or if he want to demolish the building and most of the above has to be through court evidence;;; also there is 6 months afetr you got the information in written before evacuation.	1

Just find a new place. You will likely find better and cheaper. Leave your greed stricken landlord without a tenant. That will wake him up with no income coming in.	0

If you have car; you can get a cheaper rooms outside Doha and just get-up earlier when going to work.	0

Sorry If I was not able to make it clear. I just accidentally hit the submit button and I can't find any delete or edit button to modify my post. to: tatess My question is all about the procedures on how to change the tittle/profession written in my visa(RP) and ID card. I already asked permission from my company and they told me to submit my school certificate and they will do the rest. And they informed me also that I need to attest my certificate first from my country (Philippines) before giving it to them. Now; my question is; where can I attest it; what agency? ------------------------------- Ang baril pag ikinasa; sure na puputok.Tamaan tepok. http://qatarslife.blogspot.com/	0

Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?	Yup...Alchohol was only 'suspended' from sales on the Pearl (not officially banned). Give them around 5 more months and it will return back to full Alchohol sales. This ban reminds me of a 1998 ban on women smoking 'Shisha' (Hookah Pipes). It was later lifted. Its kind of Qatars way to calm the religious left when they have an incident. I would of thought maybe a religious mans kid came back home drunk and filed a complaint or something? Just a guess.	1
Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?	@ OP...you are not in Doha and so out of the loop but still can call a shame for the ban. BTW how did you get thinking that Pearl banned alcohol.

Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?	A suspension that will eventually be lifted when sales are down at the restaurants; which all have Qatari investors who won't want to watch their profits dwindle.	1

Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?	http://m.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-alcohol-ban-could-be-tip-of-iceberg-for-gcc-440454.html Qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on its flagship Pearl development may hint at the start of a Gulf-wide clampdown on booze sales as governments look to pacify local fears; analysts said. The GCC states may move to rein in sales and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their Muslim citizens in the wake of the Arab Spring unrest; said Guy Wilkinson; managing partner at Dubai hospitality consultancy; Viability. Qatar is hardly the first Gulf state in which the local population has expressed its concerns over the sale of alcohol; he told Arabian Business. Following the Arab Spring; I expect Muslim parties to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region. The sale of alcohol is strictly monitored in five of the Gulf states with Saudi Arabia operating an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor. The move to offer alcohol licenses to outlets and non-Muslims is largely a nod to the regions expatriate workers; who vastly outnumber the local population. But the decision has been met with criticism from some citizens who oppose the sale of liquor in Muslim countries. Qatar retains comparatively tight rules governing alcohol consumption; said Wilkinson. Just a few years back; one could only find it in just a few luxury hotels and clubs with strict entry procedures; he said. The fact that its population has increased so fast over the last few years has evidently not changed the concerns of Muslims over the potential ill effects of alcohol consumption; particularly in terms of moral behaviour. Chiheb Ben Mahmoud; head of Hotel Advisory; for MENA at Jones Lang LaSalle; said the open sale of alcohol was always a delicate balance for Gulf governments. Sometimes; local public opinion is heated up on the back of a combination of factors. It is common for authorities in these cases to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heating up further and getting out of control; he said. The suspension of sales on the Pearl could be seen as a wake-up call or a reminder of the invisible red lines not to be crossed.	1
Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?	when it's already a compromise between the host and the visitors. And surely; the noisy one will keep blah blah blah! It's just a choice between "more money less booze OR less money more booze"! Lol!

Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?	Oh My Dayz! When will you ppl stop ranting and raving and crying to heavens above for the suspicion of booze in Qatar? This is totally ridiculous!! Well just for the records; Alcohol sales has been suspended only at the Pearl....that's just one focking tiny area of the fockin city of Doha aight?. Other outlets and hotels and still got it on their menu; besides if you just care to walk in to QDC Im sure you can notice the availability of liquor at these stores. I'm getting very pissed off about the situation here; in the sense that so many expats are just outraged that this one section of the city has had sales suspended!! So they run to Ql to bit-ch about it; as tho if without alcohol; the world would crumbles tomorrow. !!! PFFFF Give it a fockin rest. If you need booze that bad; you have a problem.! And if living in another culture is so difficult because you may not be able to drink; then you might want to consider just going home to your comfort zone.	0

Well; the day of our arrival is fast approaching. Since QLers are experts at the long flights; what's your favorite remedy for jet lag?	for the encouragement and the kind words. How does your daughter do with the flights? I'm a little concerned with my 4 year old; who's the restless one.	0
Well; the day of our arrival is fast approaching. Since QLers are experts at the long flights; what's your favorite remedy for jet lag?	That's a great question! We have had a few flights to figure out what to do to keep her occupied and she was 2 and 3 at the time. We got her an iPod and loaded her favorite movies and music onto it. I took coloring books and regular books to read to her. I took a few toys that were small that she liked. We were also in Bus. class so she had a bigger choice in movies and music than her iPod. I also did not fight with her when everyone else was going to sleep. I let her stay awake and watch the movies; then when she was tired; she crashed out and slept for about 5-6 hours. You are going to be exhausted when you get here from trying to stay on top of your kiddo and keeping him/her occupied. It wasn't all great; we figured all this out over about 4 to 5 flights back and forth to the US. There are still some moments when she was fussy. Hope that helps a bit.

My Mom is wondering whether it is true since she is struggling with diabetes. Please share the info; if you know something... THX.	Cynbob; honey and cinnamon for a clearer skin you said. Do you mix them together and apply on your face? Or mix them in a drink? *Seems like a stupid question; eh? LOL	0

Hi QLers. I have seen a restaurant which will serve susjhi; is opening near crepaway at Ramada Corner but are there any places currently serving sushi?	As I mentioned above maybe I was expecting sth different. All I know about Japanese culture was from movies. And if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture -like me-; you can feel disappointment sometimes. For example I am feeling admire for Japanese people because they are almost the leader of Robotic technology; and for electronics they are also on the tops. But sometimes when I experience that it is very hard for some people to understand sth simple you are disappointed. In any case I admire Japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at WWII while keeping their own traditions. And if we return to our original theme I love Sushi too. Am glad that they are so good at it ;)	0

Thank you.	in addition; it is also clear stated by the labor law of qatar that once you been cancelled; the working visa is still on working condition but the company whom you have worked for will give you RE-ENTRY VISA for going back here and work with the same company otherwise automatic discharges of the working permt on the side of the company and no more excuses but you will get back after 2 yrs.	0

Dear Kasheem; If Im in your situation I will go back to my back home.I know you are the bread winner.But since your mother cant travell and she cant come to Doha.So you have to go.otherthan suffering.because every single minute you will feel you are living hell.and your mother also happy when you are her side.I know money is main problem.Ask some help people around you.If I have money I will give you.But Im jobless.So ask for help.may be you feel its stupid idea.But I will do same if I were you.asking money is difficult.But in this world most presious one is your mom.So go back.other than suffering.	1

It's really so bad that I cant do anything to go back home and be with my mom; my mom missing me a lot and I miss her also. It is already more than a year that I am here in Doha and away from my mother. I love my mom so much because she is the only one who raised us; she is single parent my dad left us when I was just 5 years old. and I know how hard it is being single parent raising 3 kids. and now cant even do anything to be with her side. =(	0

Hello QL; Is KIA a good car. How about it parts; is it available anywhere. Is it expensive how about the maintenance of this car. Is worth it to buy this type of brand. Im thinking of buying a RIO. please help need advice	Kia overall has the best prices on the market; compared to most brands in Qatar. Their quality is comparable to these 'top' japanese brands like Toyota; Honda or Nissan. Now; Chairboy has brought a valid point - the Kia Rio version that is being sold in Qatar is a little bit underpowered. I own a 2010 Rio and besides this; I have no complains about the car. I just I could own a manual version but for security reasons is always better to have automatic shift so other members of the family could drive it. The pluses are: price and quality and the newer models are much nicer and better looking than its predecessors. The big NO! particularly in Qatar: the quality of service. Unfortunately they only have ONE service center in this country; which is located in the industrial area. In many cases they could take up to two days just for an oil change... last time the car was seldom washed and they did not vacuum it inside. There is a big rumour that they will be opening a new service center near the old airport area; unless this is true I would not consider buying a new Kia but if they do; I would give it a go.	1

Im thinking of buying a RIO. please help need advice	There is another CON that can be resolved with little or no skill. The cabin AC filters are too small and they easily get stacked with this dusty weather; usually my commute is from very short distances so in 2 years mine is just 13;000kms meaning that I don't do much service in it; one thing I learned is to replace the cabin AC filter kits for maximum efficiency. The kit would cost from 50 to 100 QAR and it only takes 10 minutes to replace it.	0
Hello QL; Is KIA a good car. How about it parts; is it available anywhere. Is it expensive how about the maintenance of this car. Is worth it to buy this type of brand. Im thinking of buying a RIO. please help need advice	BTW; my first car in Doha was a 2007 Kia Sorento. I bought this car second hand from a British couple. We still have it and my wife is driving it. I've done some offroad at the inland sea and let me tell you; I was shocked with the performance. Our most recent trip was with two friends; both driving their LC Prado (V6 version) and they could not believe what this Sorento was capable of doing. Kia is probably the most underrated brand. As I said; service is my main concern; other than that it's great for the money.	1

hi i have a few questions; we have a company already set up outside qatar and we want to open up a regional office in Doha; whats the proceduers for such thing? Do we have to set up the company fully again in Qatar? Do we need a local partner? etc Thanks AJ	Hi AJ; I work for a British managed company that specializes in partnering with companies coming to Qatar. The most common form of business setup in Qatar is a Limited Liability Company. To incorporate that company you'll require; - Share capital of a Qrs200;000. - Your Qatari partner must have at least 51% ownership. - The profit share of the partners does not have to match the shareholding of the partners. Our company is in a position to act as your local partner. This is the basics; if you'd like to know more; please feel free to PM me for more information. Best regards; James	1

hi i have a few questions; we have a company already set up outside qatar and we want to open up a regional office in Doha; whats the proceduers for such thing? Do we have to set up the company fully again in Qatar? Do we need a local partner? etc Thanks AJ	Ok; the answer to that is; yes and no! It's true this 'law' was announced about 18 months ago. As with many things here; in reality it's not quite as straight forward as it would seem. Yes; theoretically an IT company can be under 100% foreign ownership; however; in practice it seems most of the companies involved are large international companies who have been 'invited' to come to Qatar by HRH. It's an expensive route to take; and frankly there's little chance of approval. We would be happy to go down this road on your behalf and make the application; though it won't be cheap with an extremely minimal chance of success! Any other info; let me know.	1

Medical test is required for infant to extend the visit visa ? People says like medical test is not required; but you need to pay the 100 QAR in the medical commision for formalities; is that true ? Why we need to pay 100 QAR for no medical test for infant ? My kid is just 6 months old. Let me know your valuable suggestion.	There is no medical test. But they will ask for a doctor's statement giving the infant's blood type (for the medical cards) and it's also worth bringing immunization records.	1

No blood test is required for child upto age of 16yrs.No need to take your child to medical commision.QR 100 is fees for stamping by medical comission on your documents.Mother of the child must be needing medical tests.Better give child's paper with her while sending her in female section as work will get faster there.

Is it possible to transfer Qatari visa to another sponcor after the expiry? I know that it is leagal to stay in the country for 90 days after the expiry of visa; but will I have problems transferring visa to another sponcor after it expires?	Your Residence permit is expired. It means you do NOT have any residence permit. The grace period is given to finalize your matters in Qatar in case you didn't have enough time; and to leave the country. Grace period doesn't mean you have a valid RP. And since you do not have an RP; WHAT the he'll are you going to transfer? You have to renew your RP with your current sponsor; after that you can transfer your RP.	1

Hi; You could try the Lake District in the UK; I have found the best places are Coniston; Kendal and Windermere. I used to go with my wife and kids at least three times a year. Weather should be ok that time of year; and it is fantastic for walks; and very safe for children. If you hired a car you could drive round the different villages and stay in a different B&B or Guest House every night if you wanted; so there would be plenty of variety.	1

Soniyaji; it is prevailing traffic rules in Qatar; if it is slightly scratched or damaged while reversing; parking etc.; still it is better to go to traffic and show them; get a clearance paper; then go to insurance with their specified garages to get it repaired.

Hi; What is the standard fees / commission charged by real estates to find you a property? Whats the best and cheapest way to find an accommodation? Thanks	commission depends; if you are paying already enough rent the agents cover it from landlord side otherwise 15day rent for them is enough;. the best way is to set your priorities/budget; area and alternate choices and then roam around looking for banners "For Rent" ; plus check daily ads in news papers; online ads; ask for references in your family/friends .. i believe over 60% accomodation are not properly advertised and just street search; word of mouth and building caretakers support normally get you a nice apartment of your choice my 2 cents good luck	1

In Hebrew; it means 'princess' and in Persian; 'red rose;' it was claimed in the release."[19] However; magazines and blogs noted on Cruise's mistranslation on Suri's Hebrew meaning.[20] In Hebrew; Suri actually means "from Syria"; not "princess".[21][22] The wrong etymology might stem from the fact that Suri is a Yiddish pet form of Sarah; which means "princess".[23] Curiously; in Japanese 'suri' can mean "pickpocket."[24] In Korean; 'suri' is a conjugation of the verb 'to repair' (mechanical devices).	1
Good morning QLers... I am 6 months pregnant and im gonna give birth soon. My husband and i still cant decide what name will we give our angel; we had so many names in mind but whenever we try to put a name we end up fighting.... i need some of your suggestions....regarding the best name i can give my baby..thank you in advance. Happy holidays too.... best regards; abbie	both you and your husband each come up with 5 girl names and 5 boy names. that's if you don't know the gender yet. I suggest names with family/cultural meaning. Then each of you get to strike 2 girl/boy names off of each other lists--no explanations. then try to whittle it down from there. use compromise. for my 2nd son; my husband picked out a name right off the bat. I thought it was so so; but 9 months later I hadn't thought of any that I was crazy about and since my husband LOVED the name he picked out; I decided that it really must matter to him and so we went with the name he liked. This should be a fun experience!	1

Happy holidays too.... best regards; abbie	Another comment--why worry about it so much yet? For all of my 5 children we went to the hospital with a list of names; then when the child was born and we met him/her and discovered their personality; we went with the name that seemed to fit them best. Sometimes just seeing your baby will help you to instantly decide what their name should be. It's almost as if they tell you themselves what they want to be named.	0

Should traffic violations be settled before travelling on vacation?	You will only have to pay the violations before travelling if the fines are registered to your Qatar ID. So for a speeding fine that a radar caught you doing will be registered to the vehicle and not your ID in which case you will be fine. If you got stopped at a roundabout for not wearing a seatbelt and the police man asked for your license; then the fine would regisetred against your ID; in which case you would have to pay the fine before travelling.	1

I may be wrong; but of all the religions or lack of; why is Islam the most discussed religion on QL; and others are meerly referred to in comparrison during debates? If so; why is it that Islam is the most argued religon here?	When one becomes narrow-minded and they easily got offended with it. Sometimes the illogical part of the religious faith (which seems to not adapt with the modern times) tends to rise up as being legit and plenty of people who stays in a country bounded by that certain religion has no choice but to make it look respectable (There really is a difference between "Respect" and "Making it look respectable") to keep their adaptive ('corruptive' is too direct a term) freedom in bay. My explanations also work on other religions. We used to 'nitpick' the Jewish (and even Israel) on the other side of the continent for the matter. Some nitpicks are not nitpicks; but a reflection of the reality (if I don't see it everyday; I never would've known the common obvious)...and some people just can't accept that; hence they perceive it as a nitpick.

I may be wrong; but of all the religions or lack of; why is Islam the most discussed religion on QL; and others are meerly referred to in comparrison during debates? If so; why is it that Islam is the most argued religon here?	Thejam; well said lucid points; herein lies the confusion. Pitstop; why do you think it should be banned; how else can you explain the religon to many who want to know or debate; besides isn't that a muslims duty to not shy from discussions regarding his/her deen; but to address and explain and debate? Qatarexplorer; you also made valid points. Yes; some debaters obviously appear to pose as muslims yet clearly are pregiduce. Don't you think that perhaps the debaters you mentioned don't actually hate Islam? People often attack and fear what they don't understand; its humans psychology. I'd like to believe that a great majority; regardless of their negative comments; are actually drawn to Islam because there is something undoubtedly real and logical about this religon and they may actually be searching or yearning for answers. I only wish that some muslims would debate responsibly knowing that they are at that very moment representing Islam in these peoples eyes and therefore bear the responsibility of tolerance; patients & respect when we are faced with not so civilised debates because ALdeen al akhlaq ( religon is manners) This reminds me of when the prophet Mohammed pbuh was driven out of Altayef with stones thrown at him because they refused his message; then God sent him the Angels (of Wind and Mountains) and asked do you want vengence? To this the Prophet pbuh replied (I cant quote accurately but the general jist of the response was) 'They know not and perhaps one day good will come from this people'	1

i have an exit visa due to expire -if i cant travel is there a penalty?	Definatley not a problem; but a very good question that may answer a lot of people that maybe in the same situation in the future	0
i have an exit visa due to expire -if i cant travel is there a penalty?	a follow up question....is it possible to get again ur exit permit from your sponsor or still valid? how many days do exit permit valid?	0
i have an exit visa due to expire -if i cant travel is there a penalty?	exit permit is valid for 1 week from issuance..	1
i have an exit visa due to expire -if i cant travel is there a penalty?	There are two types of exit permit. The type good for one use; which expires if not used and and unlimited exit permit which is good for one year. You should ask for the unlimited kind; if your sponsor is amenable; which will avoid the hassle of having to get one each time you leave the country(there is also a fee charged for the unlimited type); but don't be surprised if your sponsor refuses. There is no penalty for failing to use either type of exit permit.	1
Hi there; I would like know for Senior Supervisor position on my VISA - can i get a visa on arrival at Dubai airport for my self and family. thanks!	http://www.emirates.com/english/plan_book/essential_information/visa_passport_information/uae_visas.aspx Sometimes public forums do not portrait a direct and straight forward answer but instead each and everyone's experience. Try contacting either Emirates or Etihad and ask them. Your last resource would be approaching the UAE embassy's consular service and ask for guidelines. Regards!!	1

how much would a family of 4 people spend in Qatar just for food; clothes and entertainment ?? Thanks	It depends on what type of cloths and entertainment you want. For entertainment there is not much to do besides going to the shopping malls or restaurants. You will find everything; from very high end clothing (Gucci; D&G; etc.) to GAP; Banana Republic and department stores. No deals like outlet malls in the US. Regarding restaurants; depend where you want to dine: Ritz Carlton; Four Seasons; TGI Fridays; etc. Expect prices to be the same to; for example; Boston.	1

We are moving from the Uk and have promised the kids a new wii when we move; are we best off buying it and the games in the UK or can we get it all easily in Doha? Thanks for your answers.	It is available her all over the place. The rate for the basic wii is about Qr1300.-/1400.-. However the additional games are not really available.So compare prices and make up your mind. However do buy the additional games to the package there. Aisha-Taweela	1
We are moving from the Uk and have promised the kids a new wii when we move; are we best off buying it and the games in the UK or can we get it all easily in Doha? Thanks for your answers.	Wii+Wii sports is 175 on Amazon. The price Aisha quoted above works out at about 245; so cheaper to buy the console in the UK and I expect cheaper to buy the games in the UK a well. (For example; Playstation 3 games cost about 60 here; which is way more than in the UK.)	1

i found in qatar many places on road side plantation is there; it seems good;in small size plant having lots of flowers;i wish to get that plant seed ;where it is available .it is possible to buy here.	You've probably left it too late for this year as it will soon be too hot for these plants. What I'd suggest is when the plants naturally run to seed; pick a few seed heads and keep them till September; then sow the seeds in a good quality potting compost ready for next winter.	1

I need to change my cars tires. Can you guys recommend me a good trustable shop / dealer; please? thanks. p.s. They don't have here 'Canadian Tire'; do they? :)	QS; along Salwa Road there are numerous tire shops. Mostly they have a big sign for the brand they sell. Here in Qatar it is not neccessary to buy high speed rated tires (HR) type; because the speed limit in this country is 120 km/h. I have an American car and I buy American tires; "Cooper". If you have a Japanese car; buy Japanese tires (Bridgestone); if you have a European car buy Dunlop or Michelin. (But it doesn't really matter much. The speed limit counts everywhere in Qatar)	1

Then you don't need any NOC; just start processing your work visa and RP with your new company.. but if you want to transfer while you are here in qatar you do need a NOC.

To all my fellow Filipinos please advice. . I just asked my wife; she said it will take time for us to get a NSO authenticated marriage certificate; we only have the original marriage certificate from our Local civil registrar. . . can we used this to get a visit visa for her? What are our options?	Applying for an NSO authenticated MC only takes 1 week; and if you applied for a visa; will take you another week; plus translation in the Embassy will take you roughly 1 week. So; what's the rush? Ministry of Interior will ask you to get the stamp from the Embassy; and in order for you to get that from our embassy; it needs to be from the NSO. If you're really in a hurry; buy a business visa; or book her in a hotel and get the 1 month tourist visa. If you want the 6 month family visit; you need the proper document.	1

I just asked my wife; she said it will take time for us to get a NSO authenticated marriage certificate; we only have the original marriage certificate from our Local civil registrar. . . can we used this to get a visit visa for her?

But if your wife will not stay more than 1 month here in doha you can go to hotel to apply for tourist visa. La Villa Palace Hotel is issuing a 1 month tourist visa for only 500 QR. you can call this no. to inquire 4367301.	1

You will just pass it in the immigration unless it will be for Family Residence visa; a NSO Authenticated one is required. Try in wakra immigration the captain there was absolutely nice..	1

I am seeking an advice to those who have a wide experience on how I can settle my unpaid credit card since I had repatriated from the UAE. Please; this is a serious matter and tells me the most accurate action to do. Am afraid that in a sudden unavoidable occasion if I will be re-entering on that country; the interest is continuously rising. I have the will to pay but I don't know the procedure. Can anybody tell good advice???	If its small amount you may can pay in lump sum. If not speak to the Credit & collection department of that particular bank & say that youre currently working in Qatar. (You may have to send the Appointment letter). That youre looking at option of settling the same and ask how to go about it. or you can speak to the local bank here in Qatar and issue a Standing order to transfer cash every month to your respective bank in UAE. If you do not wish bank to know that youre working here in Qatar. You can ask one of your relative or a friend (whom you can trust) to deposit on behalf of you to Credit Card account. You can remit cash every month to your friend in UAE	1

You pass by the immigration anywhere in GCC; you will be sent to UAE jail. This is not hearsay. It has happened in my husband's workplace! Take care...	1

Can anybody tell good advice???	first check how many months payment is delay and then which bank is that if you have local bank like (Emirates Bank; Dubai Islamic Bank; NBD Bank etc) then for sure after 3 months delay payment you will get travel ban. Once you will go to Airport same time they will take you to immigration jail Al Aweer you will be having a court next day; and after 15 days will be your sentence remember the pending payment is one hunderd or one hunderd thousand the punishment will be only 40 days only. and if its international bank like RBS; HSBC; Barclays then its not too strickt you can convence them but once its travel ban even bank can not remove till you will not pay. Go to online service of the bank send them mail comunicate with them they will give you solution even you are any where in the bank you can pay them. Best of luck..............!	0

Or an organisation that I can contact to find this kind of information out from? Many thanks.	All of the above answers are good. the most cost effective is for you to carry it in; as long as the camera is going to be for personal use and not proffesional use. there is no issue. If you are going to use it for work; you have to go through the normal channels to get approval. Send me a message I will give you more details. Having said that the XLH1 is not a large camera; so carry it with your hand luggage.	1

I am not sure how this medicine is viewed within Qatar as a country.Any advice please? thanks	I don't exactly know what type of medicine you have mentioned. Just a piece of advice; bring your prescription with you. Here in Qatar; you can not buy antibiotics without the prescription.	1

Next time I go I will have a look. If it is available it shouldn't be difficult to get a physician to prescribe if you had to but bring a good supply with you as you never know when things change here.	1

I'd rather have no prayers on board an aircraft. No matter which god you believe in; I'm sure; in your book; he's doing a great job. But; surely the remainder of the passengers that are not religious; would not appreciate their fate being left in the hands of a god they don't believe in. Pilots are supposed to do checklists; not prayers. Just seen from a non-religious passengers point of view. If everything seems under control; you're just not going fast enough...	0

I can understand that.. Like when I hear something in Chinese :) One of the Prophet's companions used to hear the Prophet and his companions say rhetoric supplication so he expressed his disappointment to the Prophet that he cannot say what they can saying that he only asked God for Paradise and sought refuge from Hellfire. So the Prophet told him: Around that we supplicate. Prayers or supplications shouldn't be complicated.	0

Why don't you just not fly whichever air carriers who you believe do not meet your minimum safety standard requirements... Of course that would mean that you need to personally check on each pilot and make sure he or she does not secretly place his faith on a God you don't believe in... Actually; I was just being diplomatic... What I was actually saying is that what you just said earlier was utter rubbish	0

I suspect it is what muslims should say upon each travel. If it was that; which I believe it was; then here is what it said in arbic written by English followed by its translation: (Allaahu 'Akbar; Allaahu 'Akbar; Allaahu 'Akbar; Subhaanal-lathee sakhkhara lanaa haathaa wa maa kunnaa lahu muqrineen. Wa 'innaa 'ilaa Rabbinaa lamunqaliboon.

Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great. Glory is to Him Who has provided this for us though we could never have had it by our efforts. Surely; unto our Lord we are returning. O Allah; we ask You on this our journey for goodness and piety; and for works that are pleasing to You . O Allah ; lighten this journey for us and make its distance easy for us . O Allah; You are our Companion on the road and the One in Whose care we leave our family . O Allah ; I seek refuge in You from this journey's hardships; and from the wicked sights in store and from finding our family and property in misfortune upon returning. )	1

PM: I'm not saying I would get offended. I'm saying pilots should be doing checklists not prayers. People can pray all they want; and they can leave everything in life to God; just not when I'm on board the aircraft. I don't believe in god to get me down safely; I DO believe in the pilots to get me down safely. Veri: It's actually not rubbish. Following link is an example where pilots have relied on God to get them down; but he failed. Maybe if they had done their job proper; those people wouldn't be dead today. That's all I'm saying. http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/court-in-italy-convicts-pilot-who-prayed-before-crash/ As one of the readers have written in his comment to this article: "The Lord may be my Shepherd; but I dont want Him as my Pilot".

This happened during the prohpet's time; after finishing a prayer; a man got outside the mosque and did not find his camel which he left. the man; surprised; said I depended on God! (which we should do) and the prophet replied; tie it and depend on God! So I agree with those who should confirm checklist is completed and not just depending on god while the tank would run out halfway!	0

Why don't you guys READ my posts. I DON'T mind when people pray. I DO mind when they leave everybody's fate in the hands of God. If you know your English; you will understand that "I DO mind when they leave...." doesn't mean "I DO mind that they all leave..." In other words; I'm not saying everyone is leaving everything to God; but some do and it only takes one bad apple. That's all I said. QL: I can handle religion just fine. I just can't handle when religious people can't handle the truth. Veri: Nope; the one thing I can promise you I wouldn't do if I knew we were crashing; is scream "I believe; I believe...". I would be looking for the nearest exit and if time permitted; I would write a letter to my family. But that's just me... If everything seems under control; you're just not going fast enough...	0

if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	faithful - truthful; loyal; or true (to you). As for relationships broken caused by being away w/ each other; only your guilt of conscience can help you realized that. It's a matter of choosing your own destiny.	1
if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	it doesn't matter if your wife tell you such. If you don't wanna have an affair; you just don't.

if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	FranElizabeth; just for curiosity sake; did you let her husband know ? I ask because I was in a similar situation. Only it was my friend/colleague. She used to have fun while her family/husabnd thought she was with me / busy in a business meeting. Whenever her husband called to inquire I had to lie (as she asked me to before leaving with her BF). I thought it was'nt my business to interfere in her private affair - but once her husband asked me directly if there is another man in her life and I had to lie. She is no more a friend but I carry a guilt because I know her husband really cared for her and looked after the kids in her absence.	0

if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	Darling; Unfaithful is just a word; nobody really give a important to it.men are men if they slept with other ladies it doesn't mean he loves her or he is ready to give up his family hey!! come on.. if you only look on scientific side its so simple... men needs to ejaculate once or twice a month (if i'm right?)but;anyway; they have to for health reason how they do it; its up to them. for women we don't need because we menstrual period every month. and husband without his wife on his side is very difficult.the stress of everyday routine. sometimes you have to understand that men are not saint. as a wife you know your husband very well. women working away from home like middle east are not looking for married man because of sex experience.. they are looking for "knight in a shining armor" shoulder to lean on. stable and good paying job;huge bank account one who can give them what they want.easy life.extra curricular activities for free.mostly no string attached. hey! its not the end of the world welcome to computer age.. you can do something productive than crying and feeling sorry for yourself you can twist everything its all up to you.cheers	1
if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	just because he is here and you are there; is no reason to accept his unfaithfulness. Just like him; you are alone...have you cheated on him? My guess is no. You have to make the decision as to what you can live with and what you can't. Don't just take it because he's a man...be a woman and have respect enough for yourself and do what is right for you and children. When he returns; have him get tested for any and all sexually transmitted diseases before you let him back in the house because if he has them; so will you if you let him back in your bed. If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous; he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-	1
if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	Men don't HAVE to ejaculate each month!! Who in the world fed you that line of BS???!!! There is no health reason for this "need". Men and women's sex drives are basically the same..its how its dealt with that's different. You are giving the male the excuse to go find someone to have sex with because he "needs" to??? Get real!! There is no biological requirement for that. And even if there was; they can always give THEMSELVES a helping hand..they don't have to go looking for a woman to have an affair with. Geez...get real.. If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous; he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-	0
if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	rajah it depends on HOW you found out!; is it thru your own knowledge; or just a message from your friend; or your relatives gave you that information. sometimes it is very deceiving when things came up into our minds. Here is a classic sample.. The Boss and the Secretary.. One day the two of them drove to the Hotel; someone saw them while entering into the hotel; after an hour; the two left the Hotel. This witness spread the news that the two have an affair; they went to the hotel to release their desire. (Take note the witness wasn't sure what really happen inside the hotel) The truth is; The Boss and the Secretary went to the Hotel to talk to the Manager of how they can promote their company with the help of the Hotel. for the meantime just trust your husband.. he maybe unfaithful as what they say but still he is your husband and the father to your kids. <a href="http://cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/pdchap.pl?file=3753&occ=27">RACHE ist Bergwerk saith der Lord</a>	1

if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	Rajah; u may cry a river over the situation; but my dear; u've gotta be strong. This thing (sadly) happens whether he's assigned to work there or in ME. U said u've talked 2 the girl and could'nt do anything... well u better do sumthing while u cry girl! crying isn't always a sign of defeat... Once he comes back home; show him how faithfull you've been opposed to what he has done; if this wont make him realize his mistake and rectified his misdoings; then by all means -dejar que se vaya; termine! -easier said than done eh? yes it is but if worst comes to worst - why settle to an UNFAITHFULL husband when you deserve much better; i dont mean u get even with him by doing *** let him realize what a LOSER he is for messing up ur family...!!

if u found out that ur husband is having an affair; will u still consider him as a faithful husband?	If he's cheating on you then show him the door... simple... he would never accept you cheating so why should you... and for all those "idiots" who are telling you its a normal thing as a guy; I think they are talking a lot of BS...when you marry you marry with the aim of staying together... if you cannot keep it in your pants (Guys)or gals then separate and go your own ways... Being unfaithful is something that no matter how many times you say you will forgive never happens... its there in your mind forever and eats away at you.....	1

Help!!! My friend came to Qatar last 29 August using a tourist visa. He is on his way to change his tourist visa to rp but he is quite concerned that his rp may not come out before the Eid holidays. They were telling that theres no work for immigration for 10 days due to Eid holidays that might start next Friday or Saturday. How long will he be able to stay in Qatar? Is there a way to extend his tourist visa?	YES; you need to go to the Immigration Building # 4; Madinah Khalifa. First of all; ask the typist (outside Building # 4) to type ur tourist visa extention application; then go to building # 4 with that application and original passport. They will charge u QR 100/- for one month visa extention.	1

Is there a way to extend his tourist visa?	Hello friend; I do not think Tourist Visa is extendable beyond 1 month. Because; 6 months back I have arranged Tourist Visa for one of my relatives to come to Qatar through Cleopatra Travels. At the time of applying Visa itself; PRO of Travel Agent had warned that it was strictly unextendable. The simple logic is if there is any chance for renewal; the process must start from sponsor i.e. Travel Agent and defnitely not by us. Anyway; you may enquire at Immigration at Garaffa. So my advice is better not to take any risk or chances of overstay since the penalties are hefty. Good luck.	1

Is there a way to extend his tourist visa?	Dear Vinith; The travel agency that we took the tourist visit visa told us that tourist visas cannot be extended beyond 30 days of stay. They offered us to make an exit to Bahrain and go back to Doha for a new 30-day tourist visa. However; we opted that to transfer his tourist visa to business visa to the company that hired him and without going out of the country. It will be easy for him to transfer from business visa to RP because his sponsor is his company.	1

My kids (2 yrs and 9 yrs) loves to drink Gatorade; i know gatorade is an energy drink (for rehydration) mostly for athletes... Its is safe for their age.??	Energy drinks are often mixed with alcohol. Where energy drinks are stimulants; alcohol is a depressant. The mix can be particularly hazardous as energy drinks can mask the influence of alcohol and a person can fail to take its effects into consideration.[21] Normally fatigue would set in as large amounts of alcohol are being consumed; but the stimulating effect of energy drinks can override this effect.[22] Often drunk with vodka or in shots it has lead to increase in the purchase of pre-mixed drinks also known as alco-pops often containing guarana or taurine extract which provides energy drinks with their flavour. avoid giving them ;make them to drink fruit juice.	1

My kids (2 yrs and 9 yrs) loves to drink Gatorade; i know gatorade is an energy drink (for rehydration) mostly for athletes... Its is safe for their age.??	what I give you now is not a Wikepedia cut & paste. Most of the Energy drinks consists of Stimulants ; some of which are used as "doping" by the athletes. Initially the drink may give you sudden outburst of energy; but studies showed that such stimulants weakens the nervous system in the long run.	1
My kids (2 yrs and 9 yrs) loves to drink Gatorade; i know gatorade is an energy drink (for rehydration) mostly for athletes... Its is safe for their age.??	Gatorade does not have alcohol and is not considered an "energy" drink such as Red Bull. Gatorade helps to replenish electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost when participating in physical activities. It is also a good drink to have when you have been ill to your stomach.	1

Many people say that Qatar is better than Dubai and other might say Dubai is better. I don't really know which is right! If you have any idea please share it. Thanks	Here is my 2Cent.. Qatar: Good to earn Dubai: Good to spend. Dubai has a sophisticated crowd compared to Qatar. (My personal observation) Peeps there know how to dress up. (Doesn't mean people here suck in that category; You just don't find (or maybe rarely) guys wearing jean with different colors on either side OR wannabe Nelly; Snoop Dogg; Eminem... Dubai doesn't have days such as "Family Day" in Malls; everyone is equal and when I say everyone..I mean it! But the best part is....Dubai's general mind set is at least 2 decades ahead of Qatar. Qatar has a vision; rapid growth (for the better or worse);and a will to succeed in whatever.	1

at which salon does it cost less to get your makeup done?	its very hard to say that you can find or done your make-up less then 200 bc normaly rates are according to the occasion.i'm a make-up artist and my charges for model or party make-up 300qr and then go on and on so obviously saloon takes more then that but hopes maybe any saloon did this job so cheaply.	1

at which salon does it cost less to get your makeup done?	I agree with the fact that it depends on the occassion...But dear I can tell you something that will be a good help for you. During weekends there are usually make-up artist that came from european countries who came to Qatar to promote what ever brand of Make-up they are selling. It usually happens at Sephora; debenhams; highland and the likes. You will be lucky if the occassion that you need to go to falls on weekend. They can do your make up for free! Well almost...because you need to buy at least 1 of their items. But at least you get your make done by a real proffessional for a fraction of the price. Hope this thought helps you. Good luck!	1
We are thinking of moving to Al Bayyan compound. Anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?	Not good	1
We are thinking of moving to Al Bayyan compound. Anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?	Al Bayan Compound used to be only for Qatar Petroleum Employees only until recently when they have allowed a certain amount of Villas to be let out to outside people. Generally the Compound is good for the price you are paying for it. Decent size Swimming pool. Rooms are quite big size. It has a shop etc. So on a whole for the price that they are charging it is a good deal. If you want better than you have to pay more.	1

We are thinking of moving to Al Bayyan compound. Anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?	Based on what I heard from friends who lived there temporarily (newly hired QP employees); or renting there: Pros: - It is decent for the price - location is pretty OK - Villas are good size Cons: - Temporary accommodations for QP newly-hired; high turnover of tenants - Furniture is horrible; old and bulky - Area gets very congested near Saad Stadium when there is a game When it comes to housing; it is relative and greatly depends on your life style and what you are used to. I would say visit a few times and see a few villa's before you make your decision.	1

Thus; Municipality never granted them approval for a Doha store.	1

Hello; We are considering moving to Doha; and I'm really concened about school for my children. They were born and raised in Canada; so an international school is our only option. But the price range seem to vary a lot between schools! Any advice? Thanks!	Try doha College. Definitly Stay away from international school of london. The international school of london is one of most expensive schools in Doha and yet the worst by far. Everyone i know attending the international school of London in Doha is about to leave the school. Poor education and a total waste our kids time to send them to this school. Stay away of this school and try other ones. Such as Global; Doha College; DESS. We and our friends had a terrible experience in regards to learning. Some of us managed to send the kids to other school and some are looking for places for their kids.	1

Should I buy an IPhone here in the US and bring it to Doha (have it unlocked there) OR should I wait until I move to Doha in August? Will Vodaphone be up and running then? Any advice is helpful!

Should I buy an IPhone here in the US and bring it to Doha (have it unlocked there) OR should I wait until I move to Doha in August? Will Vodaphone be up and running then? Any advice is helpful! Thanks!	I would suggest to buy it from here in Qatar but it's rather expensive.. Got mine at QRS 2500. You can also buy it from the US and have it jailbroken here.. softwares (for unlocking and jailbreaking) are also available on the net; specifically on eBay. The problem is that 3G iPhones doesn't have an unlocking software yet in the market.. only for 2Gs... just check first before purchasing or you'll end up with a phone that doesn't support the network. Have you considered buying a Nokia 5800 instead of an iPhone? :P	1

Has anyone been to that restraunt on the pearl owned by chef ramsey ?	So the Food is good :) How expensive is expensive? for a 3 course meal ?	0
Has anyone been to that restraunt on the pearl owned by chef ramsey ?	Not that impressed; overpriced - the concept is apparently upmarket pub grub but at michelin star prices. Usual stroy in Qatar - let us rip the expat off who are so stupid as to go there. His michelin starred french food restaurant in claridges in london is not as expensive as the bloody burger you get. Better food to be had elsewhere in town. Another note; like most food outlets on the pearl; expect to be ripped off; over priced and bad. Except Carluccios which is ok.	1

can anyone tell me abt recruitment procedure in qatar airways......	<a><strong> All companies would look at experience; education; but they wouldn't hire people just to hire them. They would need an "open position"; and they would want to evaluate many people who's CV matches the requirements; and chose ONE person to fill that position. The companies will post the jobs on their websites just as a formality but finally these jobs will be filled with less competent guys who are the relatives/friends of those cunning guys in the same organistion. This is true in the case of companies like Qatar Petroleum etc. For example;SAP recruitment process in QP now is 100 percent illegal as many qualified guys are not considered even for the initial phase of interview so as to reserve the posts for the lucky relatives/friends of those cunning guys in QP.

Hi there. My baby is 7 months old.

Which car is better manual or automatic?	Personally; in Qatar; Auto. There are so many idiots around that it is much easier to concentrate fully on the road; rather than the gears. There is also not alot of 'smooth' driving in Doha; lots of stop; start; stop at traffic signals; so automatic saves all that '1st gear; neautral' arm-work. Just my opinion!	1
Which car is better manual or automatic?	Due to traffic congestion; preference for automatic gear. If you buy new vehicle; then go for Automatic gear vehicle. Manual gear vehcile is going away from the current market.	1
Which car is better manual or automatic?	It is preferable to go for automatic for ease of driving and better focus on road to reach your destination...............more importantly traffic is growing in GCC and if u intend to drive down to Dubai..............than better have automatic car to ease ur tension and stress building on roads.................	1
Which car is better manual or automatic?	for girls : automatic for boys : automatic is better bt still manual is ok	1

In the US you can get them at banks and almost any store or Western Union. Where can I get one here in Qatar? I do not want to transfer money but I need to send a check and a personal check won't work.	depends on where u want to send money; most exchanges will give a certified cheque drawn on a bank in the receiving country a low rate; most Indians seem to send their money this way; costs only a few riyals rather than the 30 riyals my exchange charges or the much higher Western Union rates. I have used it to issue cheques in the UK and the Eurozone Much cheaper than a telegraphic transfer but u have the postal delay and have to wait for the cheque to clear. Go to a good exchange; they may have an account the country ure interested in. above all don't send your money thru the banks as their rates are higher. try the Post office as well and make ur choice good luck	1

First check for RAM and HDD first. If u have a 4GB under memory in ur pc that upgrade ur pc from 2 GB to 4GB more and HDD speed is 7200RPM better than 5400RPM. Some raptop computer change to CPU.

BTW what is Raptop bcchoo? Back to topic.. Gaming:? you need dedicated 1Gb GPU; 4 to 8;16 Gb of RAM Processor: Core2duo will be fine; but recommended i7 preferably with (thunderbolt). Note: OS with 32-bit will suffer nowadays. i.e. if you are using CS5 (Photoshop) it will cry out loud. OS: 64-bit is recommended.

Dear All Which is the best way to send money from doha to home country ? Regards Naeem Khan	If you have ICICI bank account in India from any of your family member; then you can send it through Gulf Exchange near Al Fardan. Gulf exchange will charge you Qar.15/- transaction and it will get credited in 12 working hours; means if you deposit in morning; ICICI account in india will be get credited by evening and also they pay a good exchange rate compare to other exchanges in doha. The only you need for this is ICICI bank account number; Name of the account holder; Branch; and amount. This service is known as Instant Transfer; you can check or ask about ICICI transfer on Indian counters available in Gulf Exchange. I prefer this is the safe way compare to western union; amount ger directly credited in Indian bank account also high rupee value compare to western union.	1

I'm moving to Doha in next month or so with work. I wanna buy a few things for while I'm there; like new laptop; Blackberry phone; digital camera and some good clothes. Is it cheaper to buy these sorta things in Qatar than in UK?	Dixons duty free and save the VAT. I saved 150 pound on my Mac at Heathrow. Pretty much all electronics are MORE expensive here than any where in the World. Pocket digital cameras average about 60-100 pound more. I saw a laptop I brought my Dad in the UK going for almost DOUBLE here in Carrefour. I find it cheaper to shop at amazon and pay aramex to ship it here and it's STILL CHEAPER !! Obviously this won't work with a huge TV but everything else get back home. Also anyone with a residents permit for Qatar can buy stuff in the UK and get the VAT back at the airport. Always remember to do this when you buy expensive things on your holidays.	1

Is Facebook better than MySpace or the other way around?	nfh...the only personal info you get plastered all over the internet is the info you provide. facebook can not find out anything about you that you don't tell it...there is no spyware in it that follows you around to other sites and sees what kind of person you are from other internet activity...the whole mess about personal information abuse was that it was going to be used as a statistics tool for marketing purposes if you're uncomfortable with sharing some stuff then don't! facebook doesn't require any real information from you...the fact that you can open a fake account proves that facebook is not out there to get you and your personal information though; if it was that kinda site it would be much much harder to open a fake account.	1

Even if you de-activate your account it is always there... that is one thing with Facebook you can never EVER really get rid of the account... you de-activate and the minute you wanna go back you just log in and its up and running again.

Hi everyone. I have been in Doha for 5 months; but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back; but I would like to bring my dog with me. It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?	How would you drive here? You; as a female; are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. I don't know where you're coming from but if; for example; you're coming from UAE - you would need the proper documents issued by the UAE authorities/vets; probably documents allowing you to import/transit an animal via Saudi (if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him; his sister; or his daughter or his mother) and then more docs to allow the dog to enter Qatar. If you're coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through; it gets even more complicated on the document side. I suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry/transit through their country	0
Hi everyone. I have been in Doha for 5 months; but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back; but I would like to bring my dog with me. It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?	And I will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it's documents in order - and that goes for every country we will transit. Also; I would have my stepfather come and pick me up in Saudi; as women are not allowed to drive there. When I was last in Doha; I was told that bringing a Great Dane was illegal and impossible; but now I see that they are only restricted; so I guess I have all my questions answered. Luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard; so apart from the heat; the dog wouldn't get it any better. :)	0

Saudi may not recognize your step father as your step father. You should check that out before making any firm plans.	0

Hi everyone. I have been in Doha for 5 months; but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back; but I would like to bring my dog with me. It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?	Great Danes are not banned in Qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into Qatar. Whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information. Please go to www.qatarpetrelocators.com for info and mail contact@qatarpetrelocators.com for assistance with brining your animal. Doha is not a bad place for pets. Its the same the world over. Just because Qatar is a small country; it seems like we are over run with animals. Just remember that when taking your pet from Qatar - Europe (if thats where you go to next) requires added documentation.	1

I drove by Cultural Village in West Bay this week and the guard said it would open maybe next month. I thought it was open. Anyone have any info? Or is there a contact number floating around there somewhere?	there are a couple of restaurants that are opening within the next few months; i think. i visited with a friend of mine and we saw a nice Indian Restaurant and an Egyptian traditional restaurant. i dont know if they are fully open but we saw some people inside. we also saw some other restaurants right in front of the beach area. one was looking like a nice lounge with great interiors! (we saw only from the outside of course!) and the bigger restaurant looks like they will have a show kitchen (with glass windows to see the kitchen). the place is huge with a nice view of the pristine beach. they have cleaners everywhere to keep the place tidy. i cant wait for it to open to the public. im sure it will be one of the nicest spots in Doha.	0

What is shelf life of car's tires and how can I know while buying new one.	shelf life: http://www.foodprocessing-technology.com/glossary/shelf-life.html about tire shelf life: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3088188 http://www.advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=459895 one said he had over 5 year old tires mounted and they are perfect for a few years... it is not the km you drive it is how you drive and they are work out it is also not the years... again it is HOW you drive and they are worn out. but before you mount them they have to be save.. I try to google and no one has a 100% correct answer to this Q.. but at the end they have to be save so just dont by old tires; it is your safety buy fresh new and crispy not spoiled tires and be save.	1
What is shelf life of car's tires and how can I know while buying new one.	MRST2009 thanks for the joke early in the morning. Shelf life for tires is 2 years; 60;000km or 3 years is after you mount them.	1
What is shelf life of car's tires and how can I know while buying new one.	from the web... Should tires be assigned a shelf life; like groceries; milk or eggs? A safety research group says aging tires develop cracks or weaken when they sit around unused. Tire makers in Britain have just issued a warning to consumers. Replace tires that are more than ten years old; even if the treads not worn. And for a tire that hasnt been used; like a spare; replace it after six years. Reviewing U.S. lawsuits; the research group says that many accidents involved old tires. According to strategic safety expert Sean Kane; weve been able to document in a very short period of time at least 20 cases involving serious injuries and fatalities in the United States; and weve only scratched the surface of this issue here. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but read this one: Shelf life not the answer But the U.S. tire industry says a shelf life is not the answer. Donald Shea of the Rubber Manufacturers Association said: What it is is a complex series of events that can make a tire deteriorate. One; is the amount of mileage; two is the abuse it takes on the road; third and perhaps most important is the maintenance that is given or not given to the tire. If the public gets the impression that they could continue to use a tire until that use by date that could send clearly the wrong message. When the NHTSA proposed an upgrade to new tire standards it also proposed an aging standard. That was deferred for two years because no one could agree on a reliable test that could artificially age a tire. The NHTSA is in the process of determining which test is best and hope to have research done by next summer. <!--break-->	1
What is shelf life of car's tires and how can I know while buying new one.	You can check manufacturing date from the stamp on the side of tire. Stamp shows the week and the year tire was manufactured. Look for 4 digit number inside rounded rectangle. For example; if you see 4007 it means tire was manufactured on the 40th week of 2007. SImilarly if it shows 1208 it was manufactured on the 12th week (early March) of 2008.	1

I will be moving to Qatar soon from Unted States and would like to see what is the best way of shipping my belongings there. Thanks	Google and you'll find some shipping companies. They don't come cheap. They all have a minimum weight that you've to pay for; whether or not your stuff weights that much. And you must select it to be shipped via sea. Usually reaches Doha in about 30 days. This is relatively cheaper way to transport items in excess of 200 lbs to Qatar.	1

I will be moving to Qatar soon from Unted States and would like to see what is the best way of shipping my belongings there. Thanks	Over and NO! Wow this question keeps popping up constantly. The simple truth is leave your stuff there as you are not moving here permanently! The money and time you spend shipping items here AND back will be the price of the items. Don't waste your time and don't be so attached to inanimate objects. Prices here are reasonable enough that you can get a TV and electronics for almost the same as at home. Washers and dryers are actually cheaper - almost half the cost. Believe it or not quality mattresses are half the price as well - shows you how much you are gouged in the US. Furniture is cheap and will last the time you live here. It's disposable furniture; replace every 5 years... Count on spending 10 percent of the first year's salary on air cleaners; dryers; dishwasher if not supplied and you'll be fine. You can sell everything for half price to co-workers or on Qatar Living classifieds area and you'll be ahead of the game. Buy your furniture here at Homes R US and electronics at Carrefour; Giant Store or Lulu and you'll be comfortable. It will cost you money to ship or to buy so just buy. Simple as that.	1

True ..cellucom has shutdown recently.. you could check with Jarir who is another re-seller of HTC in qatar. i know that they are servicing HTC but only for the units which you bought from them. but still they will be servicing your's with normal service charge .. did you check if there is any problem with ur charger ??if charger is having problem then you could buy an additional charger for less than 100QR and its available in almost all the IT shops (PCone etc.. ) Good Luck :)	1

Assalamu 3laikum; Can a Muslim who is a US Citizen marry a Qatari woman? Is it illegal by law; or not? What has to be done for the marriage to take place?	Well; you have to find a Qatari girl first (which isn't logistically easy) and then get permission from her family. Since Qatari families usually prefer to have their daughters marry other Qataris; often their cousins; you would appear to have an uphill battle. Mandi	0
Assalamu 3laikum; Can a Muslim who is a US Citizen marry a Qatari woman? Is it illegal by law; or not? What has to be done for the marriage to take place?	Thank you Mandilulur; but I know the obvious! I was asking about the law; like if it was illegal or not.	0
Assalamu 3laikum; Can a Muslim who is a US Citizen marry a Qatari woman? Is it illegal by law; or not? What has to be done for the marriage to take place?	You need permission from the Qatar government in order for a Qatari to marry a non-Qatari. In the case of Qataris marrying foreigners it is certainly not automatically granted. It is illegal to marry outside of Qatar without government permission as well. Mandi	1

Assalamu 3laikum; Can a Muslim who is a US Citizen marry a Qatari woman? Is it illegal by law; or not? What has to be done for the marriage to take place?	About culture: I just CANNOT relate to most of the "Arab Americans". The Gulf is where I belong; I follow Arab culture in every way. Every day I find my desire to live in Qatar multiply exponentially. I just do not like Western culture; I dont know why I was born in America. It just is not "me"; I just cannot do anything Western; I tried once; and now ask myself why did I even try to be like a Westerner? Everything in Western culture is backwards to me. This is not my society. Its NOT that I am "trying too hard" or anything; but it just comes naturally to me to be Arab; and do things the Arab way. Not every single Gulf Arab is perfect; I know this; and every country has its problems; but you have to admit; this is a beautiful; traditional country with a lot of history. And to those who said I should marry in Europe or USA; WHAT WERE YOU THINKING when you told me this?! Not only is that illegal; but absolutely wrong. Ahhhh my difficult life; good thing Islam prevents me from commiting suicide....	0

Assalamu 3laikum; Can a Muslim who is a US Citizen marry a Qatari woman? Is it illegal by law; or not? What has to be done for the marriage to take place?	Being Arab isn't enough out here dude. These people; as good as they are discriminate amongst each other over family name and color let alone an outsider coming in. Try as you will; come here and it wont take you long to realize you will never belong. You will never be one of them. Its an elite club you are born into. These are not insults to these people; I like them very much. I work with one westerner only the rest are Qatari. I live in an exclusively Qatari neighborhood. I pray with them in the mornings and evenings and sit with them in their homes but the fact is even if I marry one; have kids and die here... me and the kids I will produce will never be one of them. NEVER. You talk about marrying a girl from here..Their parents know what I say is true and that's why you will have a hard time to find one to marry and an even harder time keeping one if you do marry her. No one is trying to take anything from you man. These are simple things you need to know before you come out here with altruistic ideas and end up with an angry heart. Again; I say you should try Saudi or Yemen; these issue do not exist to the extent there that they do here. ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/	1

want to buy supplement from US but need to know if any restriction by gov. / health ministry. tq	once the suplemments arrive into Qatar they will go to Customs and also to the Health authorities to give the clearance; then you will receive your stuff. If health authorities do not issue the clearance your stuff is simply seized and you might probably end up loosing your money.

In his post match interview; Pakistan captain Shoeb Malik apologised to all the Muslims for pakistan not winning the T20 world cup.. What does he mean...? Muslims from India support India and I am sure it is likewise in all other countries. Mr. Malik has taken for granted that Pakistan plays on behalf of all the muslims? ...Regrettable...	Well said...

Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? Can this be brought from outside the country? Will there be checking for this at the Doha Airport when you arrive from outside?	They sell all of those group of drugs in the pharmacy; some you will need a local prescription for (available from a primary health doctor or specialist) but usually just buy over the counter. You are required to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when entering Qatar in case you get checked but as long as you are just taking the medication for yourself and not trying to import it for others you will be ok. Receiving medications of any kind by post is an absolute no. It is illegal and anything medicinal will be kept by customs (including a face mask I ordered from Elemis but I did get it back.)	1

As above I have a decent road / touring bike; I have read some of the threads regarding cycling. Does anyone know how much Airlines charge to bring a 'boxed' bycycle;many thanks	I was chatting to someone about cycling at the weekend. Apparently i've done the right thing shipping my bikes out as buying a decent brand new here will cost 2-3 times as much as elsewhere. Best check with companies such as Excess Baggage Company or other freight forwarders re shipping costs. Most will send a bike boxed if you take the pedals and bars off. Don't go to the airline direct; you'll get ripped off.	1

Ive been looking to sign up for a gym after ramadan. and i was wondering if anyone here knew how much they charged at aspire gym (women's section ).	The 150 QAR per month mentioned by a previous poster is the 'add-on' price for using the gym. You have to also have paid for membership; which is 200 QAR per month. So; it works out at 350 per month. I was there this morning making enquiries. They are not accepting any new members until after Ramadan. Membership begins at the first of the month; so that means new members will be accepted from 1st October. You can attend a class without being a member. There's a charge of 50 QAR per class. You can't do this with the gym though. They have spinning; pilates; circuit training; yoga; etc. They also do guided tours of the facilities on Monday; but these won't resume until after Ramadan. Hope this helps.	1

Better to find a friend with a karaoke machine and bar fridge.	1

The closest KTV setup would be Filipino Cultural Center in Matar Kadeem. It a resto hang-out place that sometimes live bands would play. They also have rooms with karaoke that would cater to small groups for parties.	0

I see the remnants of the Ottoman Empire in some of the remaining forts; but what about the British Empire? Any sites or influence on Qatar and Qatari culture today that you see?	Are you kidding? This place still IS still part of the Anglo Empire (now being run by the Americans rather than the Brits but still Anglo). Favorite sport: English football/soccer. Huge effort to get the WC 2022 here. Language: more people speak English than Arabic in Qatar. Primary/secondary education: British curriculum (or versions of it) prevails and is most sought Universities: colonies of American universities Economy: petroleum products extracted by mostly American companies; distributed by mostly American companies and used to fuel Anglo Empire and other economies. Professional class: lots of Brits and other Anglos managing everything from banks to education to infrastructure Shopping: malls are American look-a-likes packed with shops that are all over Anglo world. Whole concept of mass shopping like this indoors is American. Health: people getting obese just like in other parts of the Anglo Empire as they feast on burgers; chicken nuggets; fries and Coke. Defense: Mostly-American made weapons and a big US military presence Politics: Considered a close ally of Britain; US and other parts of the Anglo Empire. Cars: The favorite Land Cruiser is made in Toyota's American factories. Dress: Blue jeans (American) and business suits (English) prevail. A Gap in every mall. I am not saying this is good or bad. It simply is; and personally have no problem with it.	1

I see the remnants of the Ottoman Empire in some of the remaining forts; but what about the British Empire? Any sites or influence on Qatar and Qatari culture today that you see?	Britain was not a big influence when it was a protectorate; but as Olympics wrote; a much larger influence afterwards and indirectly (via other parts of the old Empire). I suppose it all depends on how you interpret empire.	0

Also; I came to know that some Indian DTH works in Qatar also. Please advice which are the Indian DTH services are available in Qatar.	Well it is not legal in qatar; however; for viewing some indian DTH here are the few choices 1) Install a 8 feet parabolic dish with Prime focus lnb; and you can view all channels from Big TV HD 2) normal big dish for Airtel 3) this works best in States ; but can try it is called a sling box; install one on your home town and one here; and the program gets streamed and you need only internet connection here Hope this helps	1

I would like to buy a laptop for my personal use. Any suggestions which brand of laptop is good. I need a good quality and good brand? Dell;Toshiba; HP?????	There are several considerations in buying laptops and here are some of the basics.. Looks - definitely you want to have a laptop which can be mistakenly recognized as an old one; so you have to select which is the most updated and stylish in terms of appearance. Right now; most laptops are getting thinner compared to their predecessors. Also; a laptop which is small in terms of screen width (14 inches below)is so stylish and more handy. Any brand of laptop can be as stylish as is seems depending on your taste. Battery Life - this is also a major consideration in buying laptops. It also creates a lot of inconvenience if your laptop battery last for short periods only. In my experience HP laptop batteries are far better from any brand. Just always remember that when you are charging your battery; unplug the cable once it is fully charged. If you are going to use your laptop for a longer period of time; it's better if you plug the laptop to a regulated power supply and detach your battery from the laptop. The first two are basic considerations. Below points are dependent on your applications the laptop shall be subjected once it is in operation. Applications are graphic designs; web-designs; softwares; chatting; gaming; audio and video; emails and web-browsing; etc. Processor - buy laptop with a minimum of 2.0 GHz speed for better outputs of your applications. Graphics - if you want good graphics; select a laptop with G-Force in it. Operating systems - Vista and its predecessor; XP is really far from each other. Although all new laptops are basically equipped with Vista OS; try on having two OS's like XP on one drive and Vista on the other (Dualboot); so you can be more flexible. RAM and HDD - random access memory (RAM) and hard disk drive (HDD) are also to be considered if you want higher applications. Anyway laptops right now are arriving at 2GB RAM and 250 HDD at minimums. Hope I'd helped you on selecting a laptop. Basically; we cannot really say what laptop is the best; it depends on your preferred application usage.	1

Delays at Washinton Dulles very few and atleast the pilot shows up. In my case; US Airways; pilot did not show up at JFK. Take South West within US. Daily flights from Dulles.	1

Did I-Phone made in China is good?(What is the difference if it is assembled in china)	All Apple Iphone's are made in China.	1
Did I-Phone made in China is good?(What is the difference if it is assembled in china)	do you want iphone made in euthopia?	0
Did I-Phone made in China is good?(What is the difference if it is assembled in china)	i think he's referring to the replicas; not the original one. I've seen them in Dubai (in the huge Dragon mall near international city). It's not really an iphone; although it looks like one. Chinese went creative with those and added few features; like some of them take 2 SIM cards; and I saw one that's actually small. they're also much cheaper (~300-500 QR). Screen resolution; software; etc is doesn't compare to the real iPhone. If you're planning to buy one to convince yourself that you have an iphone; then don't; because it won't work. Otherwise it might be worth considering.	1

We cannot reach the internet from all the rooms in our house. I am thinking to replace the Qtel provided router (Thomson) with a more powerful one. We also have Mozaic subscription. Can anyone recommend a powerful router that is easy to setup and can be found in Qatar?	The best long range router is undoubtedly a wireless N router and i.e D-Link DIR-825/N or Linksys WRT54GL or WRT54G;( thanks2 Bluepanther for sugg) you can do some twiks and try if it works; in most cases it works. - Open the router's administration tool & log on and make below changes - Update the MAC address of the router (i prefer using MAc address) - Set the channel range upto 11 - Secure your router and ensure that you use wireless encryption and/or MAC filtering and check it Beside you can place a router after configuring with Wi-Fi tools where you get more signal. Try - inSSIDer 2 wifi tool (open source software) and track the chance. Good Luck !	1

Hello Guys; I about to finish my contract on June 30 ( 2 years contract) and not planning to extend. My Question is what letter should I give to my manager?

Hello Guys; I about to finish my contract on June 30 ( 2 years contract) and not planning to extend. My Question is what letter should I give to my manager? Resignation Letter or Notice of Non Renewal of Employment? any format of letter would help.	Just make it nice and simple and keep it to a few lines which could also include I have had enough of working in your esteemed organization and will be moving on. If you ask them for a release letter; NOC; etc then the waiting just gets longer and gives them another opportunity to play around with you and you can never be sure they will give you what you are requesting for.	1

HI Everyone!! Is it ok to get my son visa under my sponsor and his surname is different from mine? im carrying the surname of my husband while my son was my family name when i was not yet married ;by the way im female..	For family sponsored visas; you need to show proof that the sponsor and dependent have the same family names. This might require submission of the sponsors marriage certificate and the dependent's birth certificate. Otherwise pray that the officer who will handle your papers is kind enough to bend the rules in your favor.	1

Hi all; does anyone have good idea about annual pay increase in Qatari Government departments; such as transport; health; etc. Is it documented on an official website somewhere? Does the percentage increase in salaries vary with job position and nationality or not? Kind Regards	Thanks for your comments. The reason I asked the question is that in western countries usually; the trend is that private companies estimate the annual pay increase of their staff by looking at government's pay increase. For example; if the government increases the salary by 3%; they may increase by 4-5%. I work for a private company; in my contract; it says the company will review the pay each year. Hopefully it means that it will only go up :-) So I wanted to get an idea of how much it will go up by? Cheers	0

Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an employees passport? It was bought to my attention that a company was in control of employees passports. I do not know the law regarding this but it does not sound as if it is fair to me. Does anyone know if this is allowed?	no this is illegal. One should request the Passport and if not given you can go to Embassy or police. Passport is property of the country issued and illegal to be hold back other by a government authority like Police for valid reasons.. (but not a Company)	1

It doesnt make a difference since you cannot leave the country without an exit permit	0
Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an employees passport? It was bought to my attention that a company was in control of employees passports. I do not know the law regarding this but it does not sound as if it is fair to me. Does anyone know if this is allowed?	It might seem illegal but the passport doesn't serve its purpose even if it's in your hands. Should you need to exit or leave the country; your company still needs it in order to arrange for an exit permit. Also;it's better to let your company have it for safekeeping. There have been lots of stories or even appeals in the daily papers of people who have lost their passport while it was in their possession. In our company; passports are stored in a fire-proof safe. The staff have the option of either keeping the passports with them or letting the company keep it. Majority prefer to keep it at the company's safe; it also guarantees that the Residence Permits are renewed on time; as it is a common practice that it is renewed a week before its expiry.	1

Am living in Doha...i wish to start a bank account here..please guide me about the documents needed to start an account....	Can't say with authority but I would guess that it is best to open an account with a bank that has a presence in your own home town.	1
Am living in Doha...i wish to start a bank account here..please guide me about the documents needed to start an account....	To open an account you need Salary Certificate and Iqama copy with ID copy or passport copy. Open an account with QIIB or QIB; if you take personnal loan or car loan.. there interest rate is very low compare to other banks. If you are looking for good service then go for QNB.	1
Am living in Doha...i wish to start a bank account here..please guide me about the documents needed to start an account....	I believe QNB has the best banking services; but perhaps not the most suitable interest rates or offers. You call any bank for required docuemtns to open an account.	1

What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?	Yes you are right osama and I dont understand why arabic staff get paid less than other staff. It is baffling to me. Some parents have complained at the new times; especially in the younger classes because the day is too long. No rizks; I want to know how most parents feel about the longer day for their children; due to the new compulsory increase in these subjects.	1

What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?	My kids learned Arabic from their friends; because they spent a lot of time together at the beach and in the dunes! It's easy as that. In their school Arabic was a must for Arabs; but a choice for non-Arabs.	0
What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?	Coming from Dubai; where it's mandatory; surprised that it is not here. My children learned quite al ot in kg1 and grade 1; they learned the alphabet; learned how to read and write. They didn't always understand what they were reading; nonetheless I was shocked on how much they had grasped the language. Went back to Canada for a year and now no Arabic. I am seriously thinking of hiring a private Arabic teacher. I'm sure it would all come rushing back to them.	0
What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?	2 hours of Arabic used to be obligatory to all Arabic speaking children and 1 hour of Islamic studies to Muslim children. Now they have introduced 4 hours of Arabic to all Arabic speaking children AND non-Arabic speaking children. 2hours of Islamic and 2 hours of Qatar History to all students. I have had mixed opinions so far from parents but heard quite a lot of negative ones. Kids are absolutely shattered come 1 o'clock.	1
What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?	Well; as to my experience; if you mix Arabic and non Arabic speakers who; obviously; are on totally different levels in the same class; things have to go down the drain. Plus; the teaching methods of the Arabic teachers and the other teachers are vastly different.	0

Big jump for the wee ones especially KS1	0
What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?	It must be tougher and I don't believe it will reap much benefits as the kids will be prolly too pooped out to concentrate much on anything let alone grasp a new language. Hope the teachers then make the classes as fun;captivating and creative as possible.. Not to mention loud nuff to snap them outta their sleepy haze!	0

What is your advice to overcome a problem you have faced with the school your son or daughter are studying in?	1.In all honesty I am not totally satisfied with the schools here; but since both my husband and I wish that our daughter should become fluent in Arabic; we have her in an Arabic Independent or "musthakhilla" school. 2There are deffo plenty of cons but since she is now rapidly improving in her Arabic; and doing good nuff in her subjects I will prefer to keep my complaints between the school staff and us. Suffice to say I guess that no school can ever be perfect! 3.Around 12;000QR 4.Arabic and English only 5.Well I'd say it's always best to build up a good relationship with the school's administration and always address them promptly when faced with any questions and concerns. This is crucial.	1

Seriously; if SA wants to know what IS now; then this is it: 1. No school can be recommended 2. Therefore this question becomes obsolete 3. Current fees are between QAR 12.000 to QAR 70.000 per year 4.English and another language of choice (Arabic; French; Spanish; etc.) 5. Administration should involve parents much more. Currently there is just a drop-off and pick-up service the parents are involved in. All together: the school system in Qatar is Stone-Age and a SHAME for the so-called 'Richest Country in the world'!	1

Furthermore; subject teachers should have AT LEAST a Masters Degree in their subject and should be continuously be trained! That should; however; go hand-in-hand with an annual increase of salaries. As it is now; education is cheap in Qatar. Cheap in the sense of low quality. All there is are expensive buildings!	0

I have been here 9 years now. for 9 years my children have attended a school where there are over 67 different nationalities. There are muslims; Christians; buddhists; hindus and even jews there. They all exist in peace and mutual respect. What school?-The American School of Doha and NO ONE has ever tried to indoctrinate my children into anything. All they have done is provide them with an excellent educational and a taught them global citizenship. Don't talk of what you don't know please. Our family values are still very much in tact.	1

If you come from the Salwa Road; pass The Centre; pass small roundabout. Instead going up to Jaidah Flyover; you go on the roundabout under the fly over. Turn left on the roundabout; drive all the way till to Manai Roundabout and make a u turn. After you make a U turn; just befor you reaching back the jaidah fly over; on the right there is small shopping complex that call Al Nasrallah centre or something like that (not too sure).

Friends; How to clear Qatar driving license all test's in 1st chance itself. Please give me some useful tips or tricks as my test is tomorrow morning.	1. Learn the road signs. No overtaking; no parking or stopping and street markings. If don't know them now; there is a large sign on the wall so study there. 2. You must know how to drive up the hill; apply parking break; release (without letting the car roll back) and drive ahead; back down and turn. 3. Parking Test - when you drive in to the space; stay close to the right side of the parking space. Reason is you will need to back out of the space and this will give you more room on the left side for turning as you back out. 4. Driving test tips.... seat belt; em brake; signal use with nice skills on the road.	1

hi Everyone; Being petrified of spiders and such like. I was wondering if you could tell me what kind of slightering slights and creepy crawlies are in Qatar. Especially Doha area! Thanks Songogga	In doha the sighting of anything other than geckos is rare but will increase as urbanisation continues and the reptiles become familar with the new habitat. There are several excellent books on snakes of Arabia; however; you are only likelty to see them if your adventurous and in the desert. A few venture into grassy areas but they are generally the harmless ones. Scorpians are poorly research locally and here generally hide by day and are quite small so are hard to see. Using a UV light at night is a good way to find them as they are flourescent!! pretty cool. Again more liklely to see them in rural areas or on the beach. On spiders your likely to find a few harmeless fella around the house; but dont be to hasty to get risd of them as they keep the flying insects in check; same as gecko. In the desert the camel spider is a mean bugger if you get bitten but then you have to be pretty thick as their "cave" and web is pretty obvious.	1

Apple; where I come from; bible study is performed by a group of people who study the bible literally as written; it has nothing to do with Christianity; we call "Jehovah witnesses"; they use the old testimony; don't think that by attending that meeting; you will have an idea about Christianity; its a sect; not a religion. They meet to read the bible; and explain it without going into spirituality and stuff... Their main objective is to attract you; they do not believe in Jesus as we Christians do. Anyhow; I believe I went into too much details; its up to you to accept them or not. Also; people are free in their believes; I don't consider that we should express it through gadgets; or crosses; or ... Just pray; and believe.	0

Like I said earlier; I heard that both Christians and Hindus had been deported; and that the reason given was that they were trying to convert others. I think everyone knows that non-muslim; monotheistic religion is tolerated in Qatar; but within boundaries. For example; the churches have been told they may not erect crosses. It seems obvious that if the churches aren't allowed to display crosses; then it's probably forbidden to display crosses; fishes or any other christian symbols on your car. I think most people also know that trying to convert people is a BIG problem here. Apostasy for a muslim carries a death penalty; and encouraging a muslim to convert to another religion is both cruel and stupid. If a person makes a complaint to the police about religious activity it will probably be investigated. To avoid trouble; don't carry religious literature around with you. Don't engage people in a conversation about your God unless you know they share the same faith. Don't discuss someone else's God unless you know your audience won't be offended. For Christians; especially evangelical ones; spreading the good news is part of their religious practice. That practice places people on a collision course with the local authorities. Some people will take the risks on board; and continue to proselytize; but they have no reason to complain when they get kicked out of the country. It is unreasonable to sympathize with those who have been punished for proselytizing; when their activities are risking the lives of those they seek to convert.	1

Your comment is not for me; apologies for this. But I think its just like hanging a small Qur'an or a "mishba" in our car; we felt protected. Its part of their belief.	0

I'm not sure with others; but if you ask me as a Muslim?....sure I can relate with you guys. I still feel its very injustice to deport anyone due to religious belief unless he/she tried to convert any Muslim in that country coz just like Ngourly said; he/she will put someone's lives at risk by doing that. Though; personally I have no problem w/ someone preaching and trying to convert me coz I have my own faith which is strong in I believe. So long the person who preaches me wont stop me from practicing my own belief; then I'm cool with that.	0

I'd rather more likely to be convinced on the testimony of one person's life.That is practicing your faith in your daily life. For me by just reading the bible literally; doesn't make me see God. But I can see & feel God through people; ordinary people. I think that's the real essence of being christian or being one that believes there is only ONE GOD; ONE CREATOR.He maybe called in many names depends on which part of the universe we are; but I guess HE is still the ONE.	0

I was serious to answer you too. I am putting a small Qur'an in my car because of its content. In my belief some aya's and doa'a in it will able to help me shoo away shaytan and be safe travelling. Do u mean I shouldn't believe it or does it makes me shirk? Kindly enlightened me? Tnx:)	0

So Apple; dont you think that reading while you drive to protect yourself is a bit of a contradiction? You dont need to memorize them all; there are specific ayas and duas as you said; and if memory serves me correctly; you recite the Ayat al Kursi for safe travel. ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	0

OK; so I am trying to get a definative answer. You said you keep it in the car to protect you; then you said you keep it because there are some ayas and duas to read to keep you safe. YOu said you keep it because you cant remember these ayas and duas; so logically to use them to keep you safe while driving you would have to be reading them right? Means I still have got no clear answer why this protects you in the car. ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"	0

After 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21.is this true..	It will be a good idea; if implemented but I will personally suggest it should be 22 yrs. I have seen very young drivers driving Land Cruisers like a plane and they think like the others are like ants on the road.	0
After 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21.is this true..	the gossip we are hearing from almost 1 years. but it's not so strong idea. because the young people will drive without license if they not provide at 18 years age. than it will be more problem for them as well as for us. better give them correct driving skills so that they will be careful as well as all of us. most of the reckless driver(young) you see on the road are having license after 1/2 or more years their driving without license!!!	1
After 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21.is this true..	The only thing that can stop these reckless drivers is more radars and to increase the number of black points to 5 or 6 when they exceed the limit set on the particular street.	0
After 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21.is this true..	Do not forget higher fines for traffic violations. The one thing that seems to open their eyes is a heavy drain on their pocket books	0
After 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21.is this true..	Hope there was some system to confiscate the car of the reckless driver; and should be given a smaller car to drive for some days... Even I wondered how it would be if some policemen are deployed to survey the road (drive thru a strech of road) along with cameras; in smaller civilian cars to see and catch the culprits easily !	0

Forget everything and pick Sony because it's unique and better in every manner. Obviously; you don't want to gift something which everyone else on the street owns.

My friend has a problem with leg broken. First He got the treatment in the hospital with English medicine. But that is not success. So; please let me know any hospital or individual doctor treatment without English medicine.	I guess he is looking for the Ayurvedic treatment for the broken leg; I am not sure weather you can find a ayurvedic doctor here. I didnt see your profile and I dont know what nationality you are; any how back in Sri lanka there are so many Ayurvedic doctors for fracture related treatments. its quite unbeleivalbe the power of herbs. I my self fractured my leg and it was treated by an Ayurvediv doctor. Recently my son all of sudden who started limping and we found out that one of his legs is longer than the other and tried with many doctors (we call it english medicine there) and many XRays; MRI's and tests and so on but no body could even diagnose the problem. Then it was Ayurvedic treatment; The AW dr Said it will take some time and your son has to be admitted in my hospital I agreed and we stayed exactly on month. Again the miracle of herbs with gods willing he was cured and he is perfectly alright now. sorry it must be boaring; any how its magic of Ayurvedic medicines	1

do you know someone who is offering a short course on basics of photography?	I really need to start charging for my courses - I could make a fortune! QL have a regular informal get together every second Tuesday where we take pictures and chat about photography. Last week I gave a small group a lesson on the basics. I suggest as a start point you join the QL Photography group and search through it's topics as there are some good links to photo basics there. Click here: http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography And on particular; click here: http://www.qatarliving.com/node/226360	1
do you know someone who is offering a short course on basics of photography?	Well...all i can say is photography is all about creativeness and a few camera parameters to keep yourself well aware of. I bought my first Canon Powershot SX100 IS and shot a few really amazing photos just by reading the manual. Most people who are unable to use a gadget properly are either sick of reading manuals or careless enough to use it in "AUTO" mode. A camera has 4 main parameters to adjust while taking pictures of subjects in different light and movement conditions; viz: Shutter Speed; ISO; Exposure Time and Aperture Value. Read about how these parameters work together on the internet and you'd know how close you're to becoming a photographer. Joining a course to master the skills sound ridiculous to me. The choice is yours anyway. Cheers!	0
LCD or Plasma TV? I beleive plasma is better for cable and sat tv? There is a good samsound 42inch plasma in carrefour; lulu and virigin. series 4 42A410 i think it is. Qr3979 Good buy?	If you're in the market for a big screen television like 50 50-inches and above -- then i'd suggest plasma as a safe bet. Plasmas give you more bang for your buck at the big end of town; and while LCDs can give you better resolution; plasma still has the edge in terms of picture quality. One other thing to look for; whether you opt for plasma or LCD; is an integrated tuner -- many TVs still have analogue tuners; which look pretty terrible on a large screen. Try to get a model with an inbuilt HD tuner if you can. At the smaller end of things (15" to 42" TVs); LCD is the only way to go if you want something slim and tasteful.	1

LCD hands down. In almost everyway; lcd wins; it is superior. if movies look bad on satellite; it the decoders fault. You might also look into NOT USING COMPOSITE CABLES as they make it useless to own a HD tv. use vga; dvi or hdmi. Using a component cable for a hd tv; is worse than buying a ferarri; without any gas. yes its that pointless.	1

Qr3979 Good buy?	i go for plasma. unless you will be using the blue ray or blu ray recorded then you may able to watch the most cosmetized picture of all. LCD may give you the clearest picture of all but as far as true color realism is concern for me plasma is the best.	1

Buy Philips; Sony; Hitachi; Panasonic but DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG. Samsung TVs will not support you for more than 1 and half 2 years. I do agree; nothing matches the picture quality but it is good if you are planing the TV for a short term.	1

I was a student at Cambridge until 2009 and dunno how the situation is now but I can honestly say it was one of the worst schools at that time The student behavior is horrible. So horrible that they had to bring in like 10 security guards and put in cameras all over the school The teachers were mostly indian with a couple of english in high ranking positions but head of security(an arabic lady) was basically ruling the school.Even the teachers were scared of her.

My brother was working in Technip as Sr. Mechnacial Engr; after completing his contract/project he left to India 6 months ago. How can i bring him on Visit Visa or on under my sponsership. Please advise me.	Salam IQ755; Send an official letter requesting them to issue an NOC letters to apply for family visit visa under your sponsorship and to exempt him from two-year ban (in case your brother was employed less than 2 years). Attached your passport and RP copies; and so his passport and RP cancellatin page copies. Further; there is no harm if he will be backed here for visit or work or whatever legitimate purpose he intents. It's a basic human right to earn his living or conduct his private legal business. No one can bar you from that so just be honest with his previous employer to avoid a can of worms. Knowing Technip; I don't think they will hold any issue against your brother for his visit or work again here in Qatar unless your brother has a lingering bad reputation. Hope the above helps.	1

Hello every body here ; Is here in Doha any diplomatic office or Consulate for Australia ? because I wanna apply for visa to go there this year ; thanks	You can apply online for a Visit Visa; for any nationality. In fact; all nationalities now have to have a Visa prior to entry. Used to be OK for Commonwealth; then they changed it to only New Zealand; and now; even the Kiwi's need a Visa. I can tell you; whatever you do; DONT try to take food in; as they are extremely strict. Another trick to avoid huge delay's at the airport is to declare something. That way; they are happy; and will; relatively speaking; leave you alone. If you dont declare things; and get picked out for inspection; you will be there for ages. Love my country; but it is a total pain travelling to and fro; even as a citizen. And; Qatar does not have an Embassy or Consul here. You need to go to the near useless Embassy in Abu Dhabi; UAE. Three times I have tried to get very simple things done; and all three times failed.	1

My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.

My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	Normally pregnancy is not looked as a hindrance. Esp in the govt sector here in doha. But better to mention orally before the tests go through. Honesty never fails!	1
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	Looking at it from an HR point of view; she's not a good investment. First of all she'll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 months (for doctors appts. sick leave; etc) as well as 54 days of maternity leave; and the likely hood of her coming back to work is slim. I wouldn't hire her.	1
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	As per experience; yes it will surely affects her job offer. I am one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt offices before; and its one of the policy that they can't hire a pregnant women even in some govt & private offices that i've known. Their reasons: 1st; they will thought that you will be going to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy. 2nd; they will probably thought that you cannot exert ur best effort in doing your job because usually pregnant women feels so many body changes; body pains etc; and sometimes some superior are hesitant to give work load to their staff if she is pregnant. 3rd: ur medical results will be stamped as UNFIT to work if found out that your pregnant... So the best thing; if your planning to look for work; dont get pregnant; but you can get pregnant if you already hired or started to work (bec. that's 2 different case)...	1
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	Even with the smiley face that is harsh prism :-p; not true for many many pregnant women; but mm is right too. Anyway; even while being pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster; pregnant women can be extremely active and bring good results on the work front. Coming to the op; if the medical is already over; then nothing really to worry about; except probation may go longer; once they know the employee is pregnant. If medical is not complete yet; and if the candidate is really required by the company; then a temporary job offer may be presented to her; and only when she returns back from her maternity leave; will her job become permanent. It all depends upon their hr policies.	1
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	agreed with Arlene advised; its all country ruling not to hire pregnant unless nobodies qualified for the post in the country or the applicant is a scientest.	1

My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	If she receives a job offer letter and later gets turned away; then she may file a claim for discrimination. I don't know if that can go anywhere in this legal system. But if she gets hired; her employer will have the right of putting her under unpaid leave; during the 50-day maternity leave period. For more details; read Art. 96 of the Labour Law (see below) "A female worker who has been employed by an employer for a complete year shall be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty days. Such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provided that the period following the delivery shall not be less than thirty five days."	1
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	2012 Olympics; I have worked as a recruiter for over 14 years and I can witness how women can be far more productive during their pregnancy.	0
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	Maybe they can. But your view is not the view of most employers here.	0
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	In my similar yrs of working under; along side and in supervising capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them being as productive when they were not pregnant... the toughest ones were those who had the hobby of getting pregnant (every year)...finding someone to delegate for them used to be a big challenge for understandable reasons.	0
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	Well; 2012 Olympics; the way you wrote your previous comment made it looked more like your own perspective AS an employer. Testing an applicant for pregnancy is nothing but an act of discrimination. I cannot argue whether is legal or not in this country; but is just my humble opinion on this particular issue. Prism; I know what you're talking about; but it's a matter of education and culture and companies would need to enforce a strict recruitment control; ensuring that all applicants go through proper channels and procedures. We all suffer the same not only from pregnant women but also from male slackers who will keep calling-in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason.	0
My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.	after the medical check-up they will inform to the employer and it's the employer decision. if the employer is ok with that; they have no problem to accept you and process your papers	1

I am in the process of shifting between two apartments from two different landlords. This means I'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one; is this something you can do in a single step process? If you have done this before; what is the best way of doing it?	I dont think it is a single step process. Your new apartment will have a meter and a number given by Kahrmaa. you will need to have that no when u go to Kahrmaa and also the receipt which was given to you when you paid the adv for the current house. You will ofcourse have to fill out the transfer form and they will make the transfer. But you need to let them know when you are shifting so that they can give you the connection before you shift. I guess thats about it. its all i did when i shifted but that was in 2006. i doubt if much has changed but here you never know. also have copies of your rp; passport and id and a fotograph just in case and a copy of your new lease agreement.	1

Can anyone help me find a hotel in Doha that both genders can share a hotel room ( without a marriage certificate)?	Just book it in one of your names; and then later have the other person jump on the elevator and join you upstairs. Be discreet; take precautions; but it can be done. If you're caught/confronted; claim you're married and that you just don't have the paperwork on hand to prove it. Be outraged and indignant...especially if you're both western; this usually works. They really only care if one of you is Asian/Arab; or if as a couple you're being really overt and in your face about things; lots of PDA's etc. Loads of guys here (locals and expats) book hotel rooms and manage to use them with a prostitute or with their regular girlfriend... Good luck!	1
Can anyone help me find a hotel in Doha that both genders can share a hotel room ( without a marriage certificate)?	Have someone back home scan your Marriage Certificate and e-mail it to you. Do a good job in color and it likely won't be questioned. Just print it off and only show it if specirically asked to.....	1

Which is the best 4wd (2nd hand) to buy between price range 60;000-70;000qr??	4Wheel drive for what purpose? If you want to use for daily commuting; all 4WD are goood. All depends on your budget.

If you are looking for just size and comfort; better you should look for after sale support; ease of spare availability; easy to maintain and easy to sell. In this catagory only Toyota and Nissan would be best choice.	0

We have booked a family holiday in Goa; first week in April; but now someone has told me that you cannot re-enter India within a 6 month period. Is this true? I'm freaking out; as we'll have to cancel if that's the case. Obviously I'll contact the Indian embassy tomorrow; but just wondered if anyone out there knows for sure?	The biggest joke ever heard; absolutely you wont be having any problems entering india anytime. Just submit your ticket and relevant documents related to your tour; it will be easy for processing.	1

Yes; you will need special permission from the Embassy for her to re-enter. I tried to do the same one time at the embassy in Doha; and they told me to come back after 1pm. When I came back after 1pm; they then told me they were closed; and refused to see me. In the end I cancelled my trip and have never been back to India.	1

Hi anyone experienced traveling going to sweden? where did you apply for the visa? I haven't got insurance; Is it necessary in the supporting documents?	Hi; I believe all Schengen visa applications are dealt with via the German Embassy in Doha. Probably best to check their website for further details. Best of luck.	1
Hi anyone experienced traveling going to sweden? where did you apply for the visa? I haven't got insurance; Is it necessary in the supporting documents?	I think Swedish Embassy is in Kuwait. There was a thread in QL earlier in 2010 regareding this issue (do a search). You may call and ask them or you may check with the Embassies of other Schengen countries (France; Germany etc.) for further details. I dont think you need insurance documents for applying the visa.	1
Hi anyone experienced traveling going to sweden? where did you apply for the visa? I haven't got insurance; Is it necessary in the supporting documents?	you can apply for schengen visa through any other schengen countries (France; Germany - pretty much all of the EU countries) although apparently they all have different rules; so look around. I assume you will be catching a flight through another EU country anyways; so just have to have a stop over probably. good luck!	1
Hi anyone experienced traveling going to sweden? where did you apply for the visa? I haven't got insurance; Is it necessary in the supporting documents?

My wife in not consuming from 8 months;can any body suggest better hospital for check up.	8 months is not tooo much i think... but anyway u can consult a doctor ; i suggest Dr.Khudsiya Beegum ; alwaab street (khalifa stadium) You need to go there to get register for first time; the clinc timings are 8:00 AM to 12:00 noon then from 16:00 to 20:00 from Surterday to Thursday. contact: 44475969	1
My wife in not consuming from 8 months;can any body suggest better hospital for check up.	If you are taking alcohol or tobacco; cut down. Get yourself free from any stress. Winter is coming. Do not loose hope.	1
My wife in not consuming from 8 months;can any body suggest better hospital for check up.	I advice to go to Hamad hospital... As Khudsia Begum is not the best doctor. Just this site makes good advertising for her... Being in emergency situation I did not get any help from her... Just was re-directed to Hamad... But their money they take accurately. So I do not trust any private hospitals. For the money they charge at Dr. Khudsia's clinics they could at least provide the tissues and soap in ladys' WC....	1
My wife in not consuming from 8 months;can any body suggest better hospital for check up.	you need basic investigations that can be done with any gynaec dr.even dr.beegum is ok for that.	1

What is needed to marry in a mosque in Qatar? It takes some document or medical examination?	Muslim Marriages are performed at the Sharia Court; which is located on Al Rayyan Road near Mannai Ra in the Musheirib area. You must provide two witnesses for the marriage. Please note that the Sharia Court will only marry two muslims. Even though marriages between Muslim men and Christian women are performed by Sharia courts in other Muslim countries; they are not performed in Qatar. But they need the papers from health centers(pre marital examination) i took mine in al rayyan health center. have an appointment before going there. you will get the result after 2 weeks. and since i dont ahve nokah here and my father passed away they asked for a certificate that he passed away and a certificate that i didnt get marry before.	1

about the cost of living for family with two schl going children in Alin(UAE) near Abudhabi.Thanks in advance for your best inputs.	Dear friend; I have lived in UAE for more than 12 years and an year back only shifted to Doha; Qatar. Of all the 7 emirates; in terms of house rents; Abu Dhabi is considered to be the most expensive but Al Ain being less populated; the price you pay for a two bedroom ordinary flat; you may get a 3 bedroom villa in Al Ain.That too; due to recession effect; the prices are expected to be slashed. The schools are also easy to get admission due to the same reason of less populated area. A quite place but you will get easy access to all basic amenities; like shops; taxi stands. Even the taxi fare is comparatively less than other Emirates esp Dubai. Hope this information was useful to you. If I come across some more significant info; will definitely post it or will PM you. Regards;	1

Delete the 2 post above please. Thx :) I have found a store called 'tornado' store and it's on the sofitel area man. It's a good store with Processors; RAM; Motherboard; Graphic Cards; Casing; etc and even up to Corsair H80. But the problem is that they don't have Good Quality Power Supply (Antec; Seasonic; Corsair; etc) They only have Gigabyte and Cooler Master :(. I'm looking forward if there is a better store and It would be really good if you show me what is it's name and where it is exactly. But if no then I should order the parts that are not available there :(.	0

Yea that Gigabyte store is one of the best around here (the one just opposite sofitel / mercure grand). You'll not find an antec; seasonic in here. I waited for 6 months for a scheduled business trip to dubai to pick up an antec earthwatts. Picked it up on Bur Dubai. There is a place similar to sofitel / mercure grand ... just more bigger and better (don't remember which one; but all the taxi folks know it)..	1

is it happening or what? When? Where?	The last I heard it has been moved to November. I think after summer would be a little too hot. November should be cool. I hope they give enough advance notification for Auditions this year. With the Quad bikes issue being reduced last year (compared to 2007) underage youth playing loud Rap music and getting drunk was a rather disturbing site. Too obvious to miss the fact they were not there for the music. This creates an unwanted nuisance for Dune stockers with families and loyal dune stockers who have been present since it came into existance. As I musician; it put me down a bit. I missed civil defense I.e. Police patrolling the area like the year before. That will automatically reduce "Underage" activities taking place.. (or atleast in the open public) I am also aware the there has always been an issue with volunteers backing out at the end moment. I think getting a group of loyal mature musicians and music fans (period) from QL to help support Dunestock would be a great idea. I think at events like these; its almost common sense that they need all the support they can get.. oh well...just a thought.... Rock n' Roll..	1

Hi friends; I am working with an international company where the new income tax law is to be implemented. Could you please help me with the following? 1) How your companies reacted to withholding taxes Thanks My Blessings.	u should understand the difference between withholding and actual taxes. As per the law which came in effect on 1/1/2010; for those companies that are doing work in the country without being registered / don't have CR/ the owner of the contract will withhold either 5% or 7% (depends on the activity)of the total payment on monthly basis. This amount will be paid to the tax authority before the 15th of the following month. In my opinion; this is to encourage foreign companies to establish a base office in the country.	1

Hi all beloved QL; Is anyone here know such thing called henna? is the kind of herb from India isnt it? Is there any shop sell this in doha? Thanks;	many bootyparlours sells them; even in some markets you will find them in packets and in cones.... Henna (Lawsonia inermis; also called caca tree[1]) is a flowering plant used since antiquity to dye skin; hair; fingernails; leather and wool. The name is also used for dye preparations derived from the plant; and for the art of temporary tattooing based on those dyes. Additionally; the name is misused for other skin and hair dyes; such as black henna or neutral henna; which are not derived from the plant. by the way; you can always use Google seach for anything ! :)	1

Hi all beloved QL; Is anyone here know such thing called henna? is the kind of herb from India isnt it? Is there any shop sell this in doha? Thanks;	dont wear henna on your hair at nights. if you have put it in your hands ever; you'll feel how cooling it is; as same it will be for your head where you might catch a cold :) if you are going to a beauty parlor; make sure you go so some place safe as many of the beauticians put chemicals in to the henna mixture to bring out the color ( to make the color dark as well to make it durable on the skinn). why i'm telling you is that once i went to a henna artist & after a few days the skin on both my hands & legs were cracked. so i rang up her back to check whats going on & then she told me of the chemicals story. i have done this quite alot of times. its fascinating sometimes :D all the best!	0

Under Qatari Labour laws; a company (especially a government organization) terminating an expatriate staff (who has worked for the company for over 5 years) is required to pay two (2) extra months' salary at the end? I got only one extra month's salary!	there is no specific provision on the labor law which states your claim unless there is an agreement between you and your company. the end of service gratuity is 3 weeks pay for every year of service. Article (54) In addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service; the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of one year or more. This gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties; provided that it is not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment. The worker shall be entitled to gratuity for the fractions of the year in proportion to the duration of employment. The worker's service shall be considered continuous if it is terminated in cases other than those stipulated in article (61) of this Law and is returned to service within two months of its termination. The last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity. The employer is entitled to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker.	1
I have a friend whose father cheated with other woman. Now we have evidence for their relationship. What should we do about it? Should we report to Qatar Police or our Embassy? If we report; will they be deported from Qatar; lost job and must back to their original country? What the best solution for this...? Any QL member; can give us idea.. Thank you very much	You need to have strong evidence to support ur case... ask your friend if he/she wants his father to be deported along with his partner. If found guilty he might have to serve a jail term before being deported.... i dont think embassy will entertain such cases. U can take help from the police.	1

Thank you very much	Thats quite a balancing act to be done by your friend before he needs to report to the authority. Lets suppose that your friend is totally dependant on his father to support his family financially then there will be no choice to loose him out. The best option is to talk to the father to advise him what he did was morally wrong and if he has a strong religious back ground; than that would be an advantage to convince him out	1

You may worsen the situation or somewhat solve the problem. In my opinion; as a friend don't ever interfere on a family matters. Perhaps; you can advise your friend how to deal with it and solve the issue internally without involving the authorities.godbless	1

I would like to tour Qatar for a couple of days next month. I have an Israeli visa stamp in my passport when I visited Jerusalem from Amman in August 2008. Can I still get a tourist visa at Doha airport upon arrival? I have a US passport. I know Doha hosted an Israeli trade office; but I heard its been closed since the Gaza war. Thanks!	Last I heard (and from everything I have read about Qatar) was that officially stamps from Israel in your passport were a big no-no. That said; I don't know that they check for it really -- maybe more bark than bite. The Israeli trade office closed in January...

One of my friend is leaving his current job and is joining a local company.What are the important points to be taken care of while changing jobs within Qatar? In this case; the current employer will provide NOC. Any comments/suggestions would be appreciated.	Police clearance from country of origin and country of residence. Having NOC doesnt mean that he will be able to change jobs. That is at the hands of the immigration to approve or deny.	1

NOC Depends upon company's HR policy. 2. Read labor contract and ensure competition clause is followed. 3. Police clearance certificate from respective embasssy. 4. Maximum number of transfer/s allowed within Qatar is three (including the current one).....ensure that new job is really attractive (financially) and beneficial (careerwise) in the long run. All the BEST ;)	1

In carrefour they had semilac; nestle; aptamil; pediasure ensure and wyeth. On the Sma website it links to wyeth- I dont know if they are made by the same company but apparently they are equivalent. If you google sma and the countries it is in it directs you to wyeth for some countries including qatar. These brands all seem to be readily available in the shops and were in a few different shops so should be easy to get hold of. If you research SMA maybe it is the same as the wyeth?? If your little one has to have sma and the link with wyeth goes nowhere then I would ship it but it'll be fairly expensive. I guess the only alternative is to try to switch to something else thast you can get here gradually before you come so you dont have a mare when you get here? Wish you all the best with the move and the baby. My research is just testament to how bored I am as I have not yet found a job. I am also in healthcare and it seems hard for westerners to get those kind of jobs here!	1
My wife and I are moving to Qatar in the next few weeks and we have a 6 month old baby. We are comming from the UK and wondering whether or not we can get SMA formula baby milk there? If not then we are going to have to Ship a few tins!!! Thanks Leigh.	brian; do u know this thread was posted in the year 2009?? so it means that the person has already moved in here..right??? it's too late for ur reply buddy..	0

I am a Christian woman living here in Qatar and I fell in love with a Muslim man.

He has the right to ask you to convert and you have the right to accept or no. If a christian woman fall in love with a muslim man then they can marry and the Muslim man should not force her. But really if you love him you should tell him that you are willing to know about Islam; then you can marry him and who knows maybe you will convert. You can marry him and he should not force you at all.	1

Converting BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE with the SOMEONE is NOT REALLY a valid point. It is your belief and faith that should be the major factor why you want to convert. Ok; let's say you converted to your BF's religion: what if in the long run; you guys broke up? You mean; you will go back to your former religion? What is BF doing to prove his love for you? JM28 asked you a Question whether THIS BF has any plans of marrying you. or maybe he's just using you.

Reflect on what marriage means and give a thought to your future if you do not convert and have children. This seems to be the biggest problem in these relationships. You may both be secure in your individual faiths; but your children may suffer. Sorry to bring in a down point ; just want to be a sincere advisor to you.	1

If you are on Visit visa status and have been over staying in Qatar problems are your passport might have been given to the CID by your agency ex.

Please visit souk Wafeek (old souk) with your dad. This is the place most tourist goes. After that check out Vilaagio Mall; City Center and Pearl. In my opinion those are only places that worth visit. If you are up to adventure; try desert safari tour or sand motor bike in Mae Saeed. Looking at your post that is the location of your dad works. there are two korean restaurants; Moon Palace and Korean Garden. For my taste; I prefer Moon Palace but it will be difficult to park therefore; try KOrean Garnden. it is located near same road as Ramada hotel so it'll be hard to miss	0

To get a feel for his audience; he asks: "How many people here believe in ghosts?" About 90 students raise their hands. "Well; thats a good start. Out of those who believe in ghosts; do any of you think you have seen a ghost?" About 40 students raise their hands.. "Thats really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?" About 15 students raise their hands.. "Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?" 3 students raise their hands... "Thats fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further... Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?" Way in the back; MarcoNandoz-01 raises his hand. The professor takes off his glasses and says: "Son all the years I've beee giving this lecture; no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience." Middle Eastern MarcoNandoz-01 replied with a nod and a grin; and began to make his way up to the podium. When he reached the front of the room; the professor asks: "So MarcoNandoz-01; tell us what its like to have sex with a ghost?" MarcoNandoz-01 replied: "Oh Shyte; from way back there; i thought you said Goats"	0

Have you ever had any unusual; inexplicable experiences? Do you believe in ghosts?	Well; strange spirits have been apart of out family for some time. They are very helpful to us. lol I have never experienced these spirits myself but specific family members have repeatedly spoken about their encounters. 1. Grandmother was about to be hit by a bus. And 'somebody' picked her up and moved her out of the way. Turned around to say thanks but mysteriously no one was there. 2. Grandmother again when she was a child was in her room when a fire started. Freaked out as she was a strange spirit (what she thought was an angel) came down and told her' "Don't be afraid." And she calmed down and she sat down not being afraid. Until her father came breaking down the door screaming like "What the hell is the matter with you!!!" But she just said; "I am not afraid." :D 3. Great Grandmother was about to touch a high voltage wire until she sees this 'angel' spirit sitting right in front of it! 4. My Aunt is a little different hers are more like freaky strange spirits not as helpful as the others. :D Her's are more disturbing the peace by shutting and slamming doors randomly around the house. And many more of other stories of such experiences. Some are indeed friendly ghosts though! :D	1

It would be a lifetime experience...either way. During our college days; a junior female student committed suicide in a lake which was inside our college campus. For many months after the incident some of us tried to go there late nights if her ghost would tell us the real story!! Well; we were not matured then and we seriously thought we could solve this case talking to her ghost. Now I laugh at myself for being so stupid.	1

My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	You should plan it very well so that you don't waste any of your time there. Search in the internet what places in Paris would be very interesting for you. I suggest;t he best place to view Eiffel Tower is in Tocadero. Try to find; a map that will guide you on how to use the Metro system in France. If you have plan of going to Disneyland; one day isn't enough if you have kids. I hope this is useful enough and enjoy!	1

My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	Make sure you visit the catacombs; which are underground tunnels stuffed with human bombs. Creepy; but very interesting. Notre Dame is interesting; but Sacre Couer is my favorite by far. If you're not really into art then the Lourve can prove to be an expensive waste of time. It's HUGE; and it can take you hours to find the stuff you really want to see. The Musee D'Orsay is a much smaller gallery with a much more focussed collection of impressionist masterpieces. Get to know the Metro system; it is an amazing way to get around. The Palais Garnier is an underrated attraction. Hopefully you can visit on a day that is operating tours. I really enjoy the restaurants in the Marais area; if you're looking for some place to eat.	1
My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My husband & I went there for 2 days by train from Switzerland (part from our honeymoon). and I found out 2 days were enough and won't go there again. We've stayed at Hotel Plaza Athenee; which has a view of the Eiffel Tower. It was lovely & it is the same hotel that Sarah Jessica Parker stayed in in one of "Sex & the city" episodes. Of course going on top of Eiffel Tower is great. and we went there early in the morning to avoid the long lines. also: * Louvre * Arc de Triomphe * Versai Palace * Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris * old down town Paris * If you have kids 1 day in Disneyland; otherwise I don't recommend it. * A walk in the Champs-Elysees street. which has number of cafe's & restaurants. make sure to stand in the middle of the street & take picture of the Arc de Triomphe I always do a research on Yahoo travels. there are lots of useful reviews and recommendations for hotels; things to do & restaurants.

My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	having been to Paris twice now. 1. Buy a guide book--they have several at Jarir or Virgin. 2. Agree with above poster: A. Sacre Coeur better than Notre Dame. I also like Saint Chapelle better; which is only about a block from Notre Dame. B. Metro is fabulous C. Lourve is huge; just run to your favorites and skip the rest. D. I enjoyed Versailles; especially the grounds. E. Eiffel Tower lines can be long or short depending on day and time. If super long; then leave and come back later. F. Walk around in the Jardin des Tuileries.	1

My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	Buy tickets for the hop-on/hop-off open top buses -you can get on and off as much as you want and there are 4 different tour routes so you can see almost all of the best sites for a reasonable price.I can recommend the Royal Magda Hotel near the Arc de Triomphe- small but spotlessly clean. Climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe for a fantastic view of the Champs Elysses and Paris-it's better than the view from the Eiffel Tower. Beware of pickpockets and scam artists particularly in the Sacre Coeur area. Keep your wallet under your shirt next to your body.Have a great trip. > May your dreams take you travelling all through your life.	1
My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?

My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	I recommend you visit Louvre Museum to see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt..very interesting stuff though... For food; try Noura restaurant for fine Arabic food..two branches; one in Chapms Elysee and the the other one off the Opera station... La Defense is another nice place for walking and wondering about.. Try also the latin square and the Arabic cultural centre which has interesting history remarks..it is also close the the Bastil... Eiffel Tower is nice but don't climb it if you have heights phobia..surroundings is enough beauty.. Don't go to Pigale area at night..it becomes unstable.. I am sure you heard of De Triumph Arch so don't miss it..you can get up to its top..nice for fotos.. Have a safe journey..	1

My visa to Paris is approved! Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	Paris Favorites: Eating; Drinking and Shoopping.no ;sure not that all limited when the place is Paris.do not by pass visiting Muse de la Mode (10; avenue Pierre Ier de Serbie)The museum is a treasure trove of fashions from the 18th - 20th centuries; it would be a great off the beaten path stop for a trip to Paris and some other tips for you; Tip #1 for Paris - If you are in Paris driving a car; be aware that people in Paris drive however they want to. Tip #2 - If you have a car; get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park. Tip #3 - Learn a bit of French. A great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is Rick Steves' handy pocketbook guide to basic French (find book) Tip #4 - Use the Metro (the subway). There is simply no better way to get around Paris. But make sure you've brushed up on your French. It will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways. Tip #5 - The lines and crowds at the Eiffel Tower can get very long. If you must see the lights of Paris at night (and you should) Go on a week night (not Friday); or make reservations. TIP #6 - The Louvre. From what I understand; if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums; you could spend weeks there; but for most people; half a day is enough time. You see the famous pictures (Mona Lisa); and spend some time looking at the amazing art. if you go on Sunday morning and get there as they're opening; it's free admission. TIP # 7 - If there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in Paris; it's in the roundabout that goes around the Arc D'Triomphe. If you rent a car and drive here; just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules. TIP #8 - There are lots of wonderful museums in France! One of them is the Pantheon; which was originally a church; and originally planned to be something other than that .Victor Hugo and some other famous French people are buried there. Make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that's something you want to do. TIP #9 - Have some small change (or large change if you can afford it) on hand for the street performers. They're pretty good! TIP #10 - If you like looking at the inside of churches; take some time for Notre' Dame; and if you have a problem with crowds; don't go on the weekend. People were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays; but there are a lot of people there on the weekends; so you end up waiting in line; and it gets more noisy inside. TIP #11 - If you want to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle at night; get there right before the hour. TIP #12 - If you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free; don't be fooled by talk which says they'll so something for free. IT ISN'T FREE! __________________________________________ <b>Attitudes are more important than facts...</b>	1

Do i still need to get a letter from my employer allowing me to purchase my personal Car. Appreciate much to anyone that could give me some ideas and Feedback. Thank you	1. Select a car of ur choice. 2. Take it to computer checking. 3. Once u r satisfied with the test; negotiate the price. 4. Go to Muroor with the letter from ur sponsor; Id card; QR250 and the owner of the car; to transfer it to ur name. Take an ATM or credit card as they don't accept cash. Muroor has typing centre; where u will type the form in arabic; with ur details and cars.	1

Do i still need to get a letter from my employer allowing me to purchase my personal Car. Appreciate much to anyone that could give me some ideas and Feedback. Thank you	We too have a secondhand car..first thing we did was; request an NOC from our sponsor since this was needed when we had the process of car transfer; photocopies of ID's...Just make sure the car you are buying is in very good condition and the insurance or Istimara are valid for another (3-6 mos); 1 year is better. That way you have ample time to have it check or no more cash are going out of your pocket for repair. One more thing..check if the car has any traffic violation before the transfer that way the first owner will pay it..on our case we just found out day after that the car has violation on the same day we got the car...too bad for us( we tried to request for photo) to check if it's really our car but the police can't present any proof cause it's a parking violation and it's the mobile police who noted it. We paid it & we don't want to argue anymore..just had it on the wrong time;the violation was made in a place we never visited and the owner of the car already left the country. Anyway goodluck on your new car.	1
If you have a bank account in Qatar and later you move out from Doha; is it possible to keep the account active and make transactions online??	Yes; baldrick2dogs is correct. I asked them the same thing and received the same answer.	1
If you have a bank account in Qatar and later you move out from Doha; is it possible to keep the account active and make transactions online??	I was been cancelled before then recently came back to Doha. After I inquired with my previous bank; they gave me the same bank account as my previous one. Same thing with Q-tel; I applied for new connection and still they asked me to pay my outstanding bill which is under my ID number (I did not pay before my arrears since it is just less than 300 QR). Therefore; they will not cancel your account even if your work visa is cancelled.	1

Is it possible to resign from the job within the contract period? Is it necessary to pay the company expense for accepting my resignation?	It's possible to resign from the job within contract period. Well; this depends upon what your contract says. If your contract specifies that "if you resign before agreed period then the expenses occured (for your training; visa; ticket etc.) would be born by you". Then yes; you have to pay the company expenses.	1

After receiving the payment you can give him you car.Of course he will do all the transfer of ownership procedure.	1

I took car loan from the bank for 4 years. 3 years are already completed. Can I sell this car without informing the bank; because I am paying with check book every month they are taking my money from my bank. How about the change over process? Thanks for sharing	If you look at the reverse (back) of your car registration card; at the right hand bottom you will see a column 'Type of Ownership' in Arabic NOUGH ALMUKIA. If you have your banks name written there; you can not sale this car without a no objection letter from the bank.	1
I took car loan from the bank for 4 years. 3 years are already completed. Can I sell this car without informing the bank; because I am paying with check book every month they are taking my money from my bank. How about the change over process? Thanks for sharing	Yes; you can sell your car. You have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remaining amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or higher than the remaining amount in the bank. After that process done; the bank will give out NOC to you for you to hand over the NOC to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership. You have to go along with the new buyer to the Insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for changing the ownership and renewal of the registration card. Cheers..	1

Thanks for sharing	Dann is correct. You can either go to the registration dept first if the buyer feel un-secure and then go to the insurance company second. But first you must go to the bank along with you buyer to clear the outstanding amount before proceeding. If buyer has an account in the same bank; then bullseye! your task is much easier.	1

You can give an allowance of at least one hour to transfer your RP to your new passport. The payment of that transaction is Qatari Riyals 110.	1

Dear QL's.... i have AOA 150 netbook with windows xp installed when i bought it;i like to try windows 7;i want to know if in case i dont like window 7 can i install window xp back;the original one which i'm supposed to replace? or i can have them both install in my netbook without any problems?help plsss;;; thanks in advance.	Since Windows 7 is just being released I would say "do not install it yet" and wait some time until you can get some feedback from those already using it. I know there is a way to have more than one OS in the HD and to have the PC/Laptop ask you with which OS you want to start; but in this case someone with more knowledge should give you a hand on that. I guess it is related to partition the HD and install each OS in each partition available; thus it has to be a High Capacity HD. Regards!!	1

Well normally you get a back up disk which you can use to reinstall your original windows that came with your netbook; but sometimes its kept in a un accessable location on say your second partition. So first confirm that. To answer your questions YES you can install windows 7 and have Xp if you install them on two separate partitions. You dont want dual operating systems on your netbook then go ahead and just install Win7 you can always downgrade later without any problems; provided you have your Xp cd :)	1

You can actually monitor what technician is doing. Make sure that he follows the maintenance schedule. Even if you flush the engine; change japan make oil filter and use mobile 10;000 Km oil it will not cost more than 300 QR where as in Toyota; the same with 5000 Km oil will cost around QR 800 1000.

I have just imported my 1 year old Prado from Dubai and local Toyota garage want QAR 5000 just to register it on their system - robbery with the lights on I say!!! Any suggestions gratefully received. Regards Tony	Just noticed you said your car is one year old. For sure it is under warranty so check with Toyota Dubai to see if your warranty is valid at any Toyota dealer which it should be. It is possible that the story I relayed to you was in fact I believe either Toyota or BMW. If your warranty is valid I would definitely go to the proper authorities at the ministry of economy and commerce and report the Toyota dealer. MAke them service your vehicle under the conditions of the warranty you agreed to . Believe me they know what they are doing and they know it is wrong but yet they still try to bend the conditions to their liking . Make them honor the rules they have the responsibility to uphold. I am sure for every car they have to service from outside Qatar there is one that leaves they dont have to.	1

Friends; I need to buy vacuum cleaner which can use for normal cleaning as well as which can remove cat hairs from Velvet sofas. Any suggestion? and estimated cost of it?	there are really not special vacuum cleaner available in the market . It is really not advisable to vacuum clean your cat .you have to be very cautious while doing so as you may scare the cat by the noise and sometime by the accidently stuck your cleaner to the cat skin ( it really scary for the pet). Instead you brush you pet everyday this will help to clean as well as MASSAGE THE SKIN by increasing the circulation of blood. Brush also help to find out the skin affection if any still you want one --buy any small low power/speed hand held portable vacuum cleaner .look for the smallest portable one . hope this will help	1

There was one shop programing the Car Remote beside QNB Musherib branch.Do any one know where this shop shiftted?	Your beetle is same as mine in term of model.

VW cars are sometime very sensitive; after remove battery sometime engine wont run correctly; ended up with the need to reset the Throttle Body Alignment; which only can be done by diagnostic tool. I did all above things myself with my VAG-COM device; I am not a mechanic; thus when i need to repair my car i will still have to call a mechanic. But he will do according to the finding of the diagnostic\ Back to your car...what is the symtomps you experience?	1

Although the car would crank up well and would not start. I thought it was the battery; and i also got the battery checked and i was told the battry is fine.<br><br>When I Jump start the car starts of well; after shutdown it wont start again. Now I have the Brake Light (Flashing) with ESP & ABS Light Solid On. <br><br>I have a friend; who knows works & repairs on VW ; I am planning to give the car off to him tomorrow; as I am not sure if the problem is with the Alternator; Ignition Coil or some ECU faults. <br><br>I would like to learn more from you; its good to have friends who have the same car so that it would be benefical to know more. The company here is very expensive and i really cannot afford the costs of VW Company. I love the beetle its a great car. <br><br>If you have any issues maybe I can introduce you to my Mechanic; he is good and well experienced and ofcourse he works with these cars daily.<br><br>Let me know what you feel.

Thanks in advance.	<a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/oi56k2.jpg" border="0" alt="/"> . . <b>Oil and gas companies pay higher than average and they dont usually distinguish between nationalities. However; the private sector does depend on nationality. To give you some idea of the possible range for an engineer let me cite an example. Civil engineer indian national working in private sector on a permenant type contract.... expect a salary not exceeding 6000-10000 QAR all inclusive. Civil engineer european national working on oil and gas project; fixed term contract (3-4 years)..... expect $500-$700 per day. So you can see there are alot of factors which contribute:eg... type of organisation; type of contract; your nationality; years of experience; any middle east experience etc etc.</b> . . <a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/29658m.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and vid	1

We are thinking of hiring a maid without using an agency. We know of someone we can bring from Ethiopia. What are the steps we need to do to bring her? Can we do this without the help of an agency? Thanks!!	I think you have to apply for a visa for this maid.	1
We are thinking of hiring a maid without using an agency. We know of someone we can bring from Ethiopia. What are the steps we need to do to bring her? Can we do this without the help of an agency? Thanks!!	As far as i know; You need to get a NOC letter from your employer; which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary; and the nationality of the maid you want to get. Take this to the labour department on C-ring road (i guess); there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC. Will take atleast a week for the approval to come. Once you get the approval; give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids; and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa; flights; etc.	1

Hello everybody; I was just wondering if there are any Alienware resellers here in qatar as I plan on purchasing a new laptop; and so far I can't seem to find any. Any help would be very appreciated; Thanks in advance!	Don't buy it locally; either go to Dubai and get one there or buy it online and ship it through Aramex. All the Alienwares you'll find here will be outdated or super expensive. But even if you buy it online; for good specs you're looking at 2000-$2500 excluding Aramex fees. Buy an MSI instead; they're fairly cheap and look cool. Or if you're willing to buy online check Sager. I bought one recently and it's been working like a charm.	0

I also took full driving course from Karwa driving school. While taking the course instructor told me that I may pass in my first attempt. But unfortunately I failed 3 times. I passed only on my 4th attempt. I accept that Karwa driving school is good for learning driving but during test because of several people there will be little bit tension. Regarding your question; Again you have to join either 7day(1 chance will be given for test) or 15day(2 to 3 chances will be given for test) course to reapper the test. Dont worry you will pass when your time comes. Before; I also more worried about driving license. Finally I am driving on roads very safely. Best of luck; Rama	1

Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	Yup; and that's why there should be laws preventing marriage until the age of 18. In most Western countries there are.	1
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	I recommend 2 enough for a women. I mean; one from the front; and one from the back.."at any one time" Polygamy... yes if you have the strength of a horse to conquer 4 mountains per night.	1

Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	I refuse to believe any 19 - 25 year old lady would volunteer to marry a 45 to 55 years old guy. This would be highly exceptional and not common. Further more it is immoral. Impregnating woman at a young age takes away their possibility of proper education/development and such. one hell of a way to keep females 'low'.	0
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	NO.....one only. one at a time means......avoid sleeping with both at a time. Aana free; jaana free; Pakde gaye tho khana free.	1
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	I know a couple of women who've married much older men; and agreed readily to it. They found older men to be more finacially stable and mature. It wasn't the way I would have chosen (obviously) but it's what they wanted.	1

Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	Having known women involved in polygyny I found it really sad to see the toll it took on their self-esteem and the way their husbands played one off against the other to gain "top spot". I realize that not all polygynous marriages are like that; but all I have known are. Also; outside of religion I have to agree with Gypsy. If it is supposed to be so easy for a woman to accept her mate sleeping with someone else; then men should be able to handle it too. The fact that you know you cannot; shows you know it also presents a serious hardship on women -- even if it is "allowable" according to religion or law. <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em>	1
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	before you post about something being allowable in Islam you should really do your research carefully; rather than just take one person's word for it. The only FIRM requirement is that the man be fair among his wives with regards to time and money spent. And one cannot exceed having 4 wives at a time. <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em>	0

Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	and what we know is that based on the Quran and hadith a Muslim man is allowed to have up to 4 wives providing he can support them equally and divides his time equally. A Muslim woman has the right to choose not to be in a polygynous marriage and she can divorce a husband who chooses this against her wishes. Muslims feel that polygyny is a right granted by Allah and although it may not be advisable to exercise every right; a man who is hell-bent on having more than one wife will do so; using his religious right to do so. I'm not really sure what you are trying to add here or getting at with these links but believe me; this has been discussed endlessly and I seriously doubt anybody will change their minds. If you are interested in Islam I would suggest you find a good imam near you to talk to. Many of the internet sites can lead you down the wrong path (submission.org being one of them). <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em>	1
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	but maybe it is different for girls because I did not see sex as a sport and did not like the notion of competing with another woman when my heart was involved. I really can't relate to what you are saying here. Perhaps the painful reality of so many polygynous marriages hits too close to home to me. In fact; I would think that Islamic polygyny when practiced properly (if there is such a thing) is not supposed to make the women feel in competition with each other. I always thought it places a tremendous burden on men to make sure they are not hurting their wife/wives and make each feel special in her own right -- not compared to the competition. I don't think most men are able to fulfill that role and I expect to see a lot of "paralyzed" men on the Day of Judgment. Moreover; I think it shows a lack of faith that so many take the matter so lightly. It seems to me they are living for earthly pleasure with no concern about accountability. <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em>	1
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	But only using it as a perspective through which to view American culture. No. It is cruel for a man to make such a competition between his wives. The same cruelty happens between unmarried people through dating; flirting; etc. It also occurs when someone is flaunting wealth. Whatever intentionally provokes negative feelings that harm a person's contentment and inner peace is a sort of cruelty. This is the reason for the hijab; and also for the prohibition (only for men) of wearing gold or silk. Part of what I wanted to make noticed is how much of contemporary western consumer society is centered around the drive to provoke such feelings - lust; envy; jealousy; etc. in others about one's self. The "if you got it; flaunt it" mentality. That people in the west are now so addicted to this game; is the reason why they react in such horror at the idea of hijab; especially; as if it nullifies any reason for a woman to live if she does not strut her stuff. So I was only trying to see polygamy through the competition lens to make a point about this cultural trend.	1
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	I have witnessed jealousy; envy; greed and materialism on a scale I never knew existed in the West. It really was a shock to my system and while I might have found it curious in the beginning; I now see it as so un-Godly it's hard to even believe you are in the heart of Islam. Maybe you haven't been here that long. It would be interesting to see how you feel after 10 years. <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em>	0
Are you with polygamy or no? As a woman would you like to have one husband or two?	and unique in being THE wealthiest nation in the world. It would not be scientific; to say the least; to take observations of Qatar; and use that as a measuring stick to judge all of Arabs and Muslims; much less Islam. First; as a Muslim you know yourself that there is a wide gap between the ideal of Islam; and the current state of Muslims. And to spend too much breath defending ourselves as we actually are would be a waste except when it is in defense of truth and fairness. I have enough real faults as it is to put up with kafrs making things up. Secondly; yes. If perhaps I think about the small town I grew up in Missouri to the wealth of Doha; then there is certainly a lot more materialism and greed here. But if I were to compare Doha to an equally wealthy place in the U.S. then it would be hard to believe that there is that much more greed here. What there is more of here; but less than in most of the Arab world; I think; is monopolization; the sort of nepotism which kills efficiency; an unfortunate emphasis on irrelevant forms of status (e.g. family and tribal membership) over quality work and capability; and extremem disparity. None of these are healthy in Islamic standards. Remember the Prophet warned not to be destroyed by what destroyed those who came before - which was that they were strict in punishing the poor but leniant in letting the rich get away with things. He warned but the Arabs after some time did not listen. So; it did certainly harm them; and is destroying them; at least socially. Still; they are my brothers and I am with them in the same boat...whether they all acknowledge that or not.	0

QUESTION: Why is there salt in the ocean?	there are so many WHY questions including this one :)	0
QUESTION: Why is there salt in the ocean?	It is estimated that the oceans formed about 500 million years ago. A lot of the salt entered the oceans during their formative years. As igneous rocks cooled below the oceans; they released a lot of the salt into the oceans. More salt entered the oceans as rock and sediments on the ocean floor dissolved. Still more salt entered the ocean through the erosion of the land. As mountains gradually break down and rains wash over the land; naturally occurring salts of the Earth are washed into the ocean. As water from the ocean evaporates; the salts are left behind; so the ocean gets more salty with time. http://www.strangequestions.com/question/709/Why-is-there-salt-in-the-ocean.html	1

I was thinking about applying for my child to attend Frech school in Doha but we don't haold French passports(only Australian and British). Does anyone have any information about the new French school - I think it is called Lycee Voltaire. I think Lycee Bonaparte is only for French passport holders. Pleas advise - I'm really quite desperate for a good school for my child...	Yes; the Lycee Voltaire does indeed take non french passport holders. Has a good reputation and the parents that i know with children there are very happy with the school. Classes tend to be smaller than in the Lycee Francais as well.	1

They take french citizen on a priority list; then french speaking passport holders (there are some agreement between french speaking contries) then other on a waiting list. Voltaire follows the french cursus; is also sponsored by the french gov. but I am not sure if they hire exclusively french accreditated teachers.	0

Which Brand Projector is good How much cost Where available. Can projector can adjust to any screen size Will thank for good answer	LP is right 2000 lumens or more is enough for personal use. You can get any brand it depends on the specs; quality it depends on how use it or take care of it. I believed the lowest cost in the market is 1900 which is LG; I recommend you purchase a bit high end projector which is 3D ready. Try to Google it for more idea and reference.	0

Does anyone know when does the promotions and recruitment start in HMC? Is it true that there is no money to give the employees promotion ? Is it true that many staff thinks HMC is becoming a less desirable place to work ?	"Give the worker his dues; his rights; before his sweat dries" by the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) should be pasted in all the management offices at HMC. Any sector in HMC which would be left behind would somehow impact on the overall performance. I hope this will be ironed out soon for the benefit of all concerned. =) __________________________________________________ "No one is in charge of your happiness except you"	0
Does anyone know when does the promotions and recruitment start in HMC? Is it true that there is no money to give the employees promotion ? Is it true that many staff thinks HMC is becoming a less desirable place to work ?	I absolutely refuse to believe that this is done because of economical crisis. It is all because of the inexperienced and inefficient administration of HMC. Everyday there is some news of buying ultra expensive technology and equipments for HMC; however; they don't have money to pay their staff. Also; they are constantly pressurising staff to perform better than their best. Well;all of us know the old saying. Pay peanuts and get monkeys to work. HMC will soon turn into a monkey show. And no; nothing is going to change in March 2010. If there was a real problem; it could be solved. There is no end to fake problems. Are you nuts?......no doubt I am crazy about you!	1

What will you do if something goes wrong with the LCD TV; Slit AC; Washing Machine and Cooking Range? If your are buying them from India most of them are with 2-5 years warranty and some are with 1-2 years guarantee. Some brands are offering extended warranty by paying some extra money. If something goes wrong you can call the shop where you bought it and they will arrange with the Service Centre for the necessary action. I know that some products have International Warranty but it is not as easy as you are buying something locally in India. Further more you will have to spend a lot of money for cargo even if it is by sea.	1

Hi QL; My friend in Abudabi want to visit me in Doha. How do I sponsor visa for them. Any prior experices please share.	hey buddy had to do this myself a month back and here's what i learned: 1)first up; you can normally only sponsor your immediate family or blood relatives on a visit to qatar. what that means is you cant sponsor your friend since he is not related to you. i have heard of some people with special work visas who are able to do so but im guessing you aren't one of them 2)now the only option you have is to get a visa through a hotel for your friend..within this option you have two more options; you can get a one month tourist visa for a thousand rials but he will have to stay in the hotel which will be expensive..your second and more feasible option is a business visa through the hotel..this will however cost you 2000 rials; be valid for three months but the friend can stay with you instead of the hotel..there's a few hotels that do this and you could try gulf horizon behind standard chartered bank near the souq waqif/souq asiri area near the corniche. 3)now depending on the budget; if your friend is visiting for long; then the business visa will be expensive but save the expense and hassle of staying in the hotel. but if it's a short visit then you could inquire about the hotel's rates for his stay.. so yeah; i managed to get my buddy into doha because he was ready to pay 2000 for a business visa..hope you and your buddy can get together and have a great time too..best of luck buddy:-)	1

Oh well; there goes my suggestions :( You may want to consider the Royal Istanbul located in West Bay Petrol Station. If you can get a family cubicle in there you should be ok. Good food reasonable price. I like the mixed grill there. And there is a Baskin Robins next door for desert ;)	1

Agreeing with Topnotch; it's a nice place; not too pricey not to cheapy and the one at Salwa Road is quite nice and kind of decorated very picturesque. Enjoy!	1

Not me. Sorry. I'm not in Qatar yet either. I've been frequenting this site to acclimatize myself and to learn what to expect when I do move. Where to shop; what to do; what to drive; where to wine and dine; ahem; I mean dine; where Canadians or Quebecors or the French hang out to date; etc. I'll be leaving from Montreal next week (we just had our first major snowstorm yesterday). I hope others can help you with what might be popular there. Keep in mind; though; no pork products in Qatar. All those dim sums will have to be seafood or vegetarian.	0

Nothing to worry about finding your choice of accommodation suitable for your budget in Qatar; or scared to secure one with key-money as in your UAE. Just step in to cooperative store or big hyper market; nowadays 100s of advertisements are there looking for people to share it; or rent independantely the apartment for reasonable rate. So you try to keep moving into the cooperative store from location to location so most of the advertisements are found stick on their wall; with contact nos. and you can manage to get one without any difficulty approx. not morethan 4000/- a best one.	1

Hello all. I am currently interviewing for a nanny.

Thanks	I put my adverts on every grocery store also here in Qatar Living and check adverts everywhere such as newspapers; grocery advertisement board and also here in QL! I never approach any agency as my friends used to get their maids from agencies and end up with lots of expenses but if there's anything goes wrong with the maids they are obligued to replaced them but it will be additional expenses for you. The easiest way for you to do is apply for a maid visa depending on the nationalities you prepared and when visa is approved; then you can start searcing for the right candidate locally who are looking for an employer who can give them visa. Otherwise; there are also free-lancers; who do not need sponsorship but of course you have to give them weekend day off as they are not under your sponsorship; you are less in control of the situation. I had phobia sponsoring maids as they tend to jump off the ship and get into trouble with CID. so in the end I just hire free-lancers! it may not be cheaper but less headache! ;)	1

Thanks	7000 should be amortized over 4 years..:) To be honest; don't know what to suggest.. I wouldnt go the way jjh is suggesting.... puting the ads in the grocery stores to get a nanny for your kids isn't the best way to hire a good companion for them.. 6000 is a high price.. on the other hand if you go through the agency; it won't be much cheaper.. You just have to come to conclusion that having a nanny isn't cheap.. and pay the fee...	1

Just go to Ministry of Labor in Mutazah beside American Hospital; bring the new passport of your friend and the visa copy. First go to reception counter ask for a number and tell about your concern. Wait for your turn; if you meet the lady just ask her to change the passport number in the visa. On the following day you will see the result in the net. I did that also to my daughter just 2 months ago.	1

Does anybody knows about Royal Jordanian Cargo accept snub-nosed dog ? Thank you.	Flying With Your Pet FAQAir travel for animals can be tricky and dangerous business; so it is important to know what the law; the airlines; and veterinarians recommend. QuestionsHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet? What steps should I take prior to a flight to make sure my pet's trip goes smoothly and safely? Can my pet travel in the cabin of the airplane; rather than in the cargo hold? What does the law require me to do if my pet is going to travel in the plane's cargo hold? AnswerHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet?Not all pets can or should travel by plane. Air travel is stressful for pets; so you should consider a number of factors before deciding to transport your pet on an airplane; including your pet's disposition; age; breed and health. Heat or Pregnancy. Animals who are in heat or who are pregnant should not travel by plane. Age. Federal law requires that animals be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned (meaning weaned for at least five days) before they travel in the cargo hold of a plane. Although the law does not say so; veterinarians generally recommend against putting elderly pets through the discomfort of air travel. Breed. Pug-nosed animals should never travel in the cargo hold of a plane. This is because of the structure of their faces; which may inhibit their breathing during air travel. If your dog is of one of the breeds listed below; be sure to discuss the issue with your veterinarian and with the airline. Many airlines will not accept pug-nosed animals for air travel. The following dogs are considered to be pug-nosed: American StaffordshireEnglish Toy SpanielDutch PugShih TzuStaffordshire Bull TerrierBrussels GriffinPekineseBoston TerrierEnglish BulldogJapanese Pug; andJapanese Spaniel.	1

Hi there; Does anyone know if there are any beginners Muay Thai classes in Doha? I know that Champions Club used to do them but not sure if they still do. Please let me know if anyone knows of any. Many thanks	Hi I was looking around different clubs myself recently and there is a very good instructor in Doha called 'Inigo' (Spanish/Basque name)who has Muay Thai classes at the Ritz Carlton's gym Tues 7pm or Thurs 7.30; or the 'The City Intercontinental' on Wedesday at 8pm. He also runs a kickboxing style class at the Sheridan on Saturday 5pm?. He's a decent bloke and he knows his stuff technically. p.s.I've trained Muay Thai myself for many years with some well known instructors/retired prof Thai fighters(so know what to look for re a good instructor). Inigo runs a good class. Hope it helps; good luck	1

Many thanks	Im a boxing coach in Qatar. I mean a genuine boxing coach not someone who has done a two day course and sets themselves up as a coach. I met Inigo by chance and we have ended up as friends. He comes to my two weekly classes at the Intercon city and when I'm away covers them. He is a fantastic coach; one of the best ive worked with. Genuine Muay Thai passion with great teaching. I never let anyone cover my boxing classes except Inigo because he knows boxing very well also. If you want to learn genuine Muay Thai then I would highly recommend him. Also for boxing; swimming and tennis. The guy is a legend!	1

You will spent minimum 3500Qr for your accomodation(partitioned villa 1BHK...managable space!!!); for 4 people you will have a grocery bill around 1500qr per month. then your childrens studies etc etc... if your company will give you family accomodation; transport its ok.. you can think about it!!	1

That's hard ;For having 2 kids;u need accomodation not less than 3500 Qr/month other than the cost of living;may be that can be accpetable if ur wife found a job this is applicable but not guarnteed	1

Me presently working in a logistics company earning 30;000 INR.	No way... The offer is not good for supporting a family... One fully furnished 1BHK flat will go not below QAR 5000/-... This offer could be still considerable if the company provides you with a family accomodation +QR 7000. Thats the most expensive thing here... Negotiate with the company or else wait for better opportunity...	1
