Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	Hi Aunt Polly, here are the details: 1. Complete your documents, check the website    http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/asia/vkwt/ref_visinf/viskwt.html 2. You will have to send your original passports thru DHL or Fedex (they know what to do) at: Embassy of Switzerland in Kuwait (also accredited in Qatar and Bahrain) Qortuba, Block 2, Street 1, House No 122 P.O. Box 23954 Safat 13100 Kuwait Tel. +965 534 01 72/73/74/75 Fax  +965 534 01 76 Public opening hours Sunday-Thursday 9:00-11:00 Visa section: Sunday-Thursday 9:00-11:00 (Kuwait have the same time as we have here in Qatar, so you can call and ask them for more of your questions ONLY on the times stated) 3. You pay a courier charge to Kuwait. Wait in 3-5 working days, it will arrive to you (either approved or denied) and you will again be charged depending if you are approved or not. 4. Enjoy the holidays in Switzerland. Its best to go there during the winters to see the snow-capped mountains and stuff. But summer is ok too.	1
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	If you are just interested to visit Switzerland, you might attempt to get a schengen visa from any european embassy in Qatar, say the Italian Embassy. If you get it, you can travel all over Europe including Switzerland.   Qatar's Online Store Shop online, same-day delivery to your door in Qatar! www.simpatico.com.qa	1
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	No offense Simpatico, but you are wrong. Switzerland is not part of the the Schengen Visa circle. Swiss has been a long time-neutral country, and they even use their own money, Francs and not Euro. Been there. That's what it is.	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	Thank you kikomodos and  Eco savvy- thanks for taking the time to reply to this post Thanks very much Simpatico , you have been extremely helpful . Aunt Polly	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	You are right the Shengen visa used to include 7 countries now more  as far as I understand as I used to get this for my ex-husband to trave around Europe. The Shengen visa does also not iclude UK.	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	so really what i have to do is to send my documents to Kuwait , right ? I am also planning to visit Italy , France and Holland alongwith - so will a common Schengen visa do for all these countries ? Aunt Polly	0

Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	The Shengen Visa allows you to visit these countries. Germany Belgium Denmark Finland France Greece Iceland Italy Luxemburg Norway Portugal Spain Sweden The Netherlands Austria	0
Hi there. Can anyone tell me if there is a Swiss embassy in Doha ? If so , where is it ? Thanks	Aunt Polly, my family and I did it. Yes, even if you check with DHL or Fedex, they know it, and they know what to do. But you'll have to complete your papers adn plan your trip well, as the processing takes (max) of 5 working days in all. Yes, you'll need a separate Schengen Visa for those countries you mentioned (except Holland). The 15 Schengen countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. All these countries except Norway and Iceland are European Union members. When you know your 1st Schengen-visa valid country, that will be your visa application. Say, your 1st destination before or after Swiss is Italy, then you have to get your Schengen Visa from the Italian Embassy here. Once you have the visa, you can roam around 15 countries! Cheers.	1
Hi there, I am coming to doha on Thursday and I know I will need a tourist visa. Someone mentioned that I get it at the airport for 55riyals, is this correct? I saw on the Qatar Government website that you needed evidence of which hotel you would be staying in? But I am staying with friends during my stay? Any advice would be good as I am quite nervous about flying alone and dont want any problems when I arrive! Thanks, Beth :-)	You do not mention what passport you hold. Either way your travel agent should have arranged everything for you. I would be VERY hesitant to travel anywhere in teh world if I did not know what the visa requirements were for a particular country. On the other hand the airline carrying you to Qatar would ultimately be responsible for you and will not allow you to board if your paperwork is not in order. Check out the Qatar Government websites if you have the opportunity. Good Luck.	1

I have not booked through a travel agency, which is why I am now looking at visas. I know I need a tourist visa, I just want to know how to get one. Every time I ring the embassy in London, there is no one in the visas department. I was told my someone in my Fiance's company that you pay 55riyals on arrival at Doha airport, but obviously I need to check this is correct. I am flying with Emirates. Thanks!	0

All need to show they have US$.1370.00 in cash or equivalent in foreign currency (or a credit card) to be eligible to enter Qatar. You might need to show a confirmed hotel booking. Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vatican.	1

Thanks, Beth :-)	I too was worried about the new visa regulations about having 5000 riyals or valid international credit card and hotel voucher upon arrival, as I have relatives coming out here in 2 weeks time. (Family and they are regular visitors). I have been told by other people who have had visitors arrive that it's no problem .. still the same as before 55 riyals for 3 week visa on arrival (with option of renewing for the extra week at 50QR). Fingers crossed.	0

I have a british credit card, like Natwest and Alliance and Leicester, I dont know if that counts as international though. I'm worried that they will ask for hotel reservation details and then there will be a problem when they realise I intend to stay with male friends....:S I will ring the embassy on Monday to confirm. It says on world travel guide you have to fly in on Qatar Airlines to geta tourist visa, surely that is wrong! Im flying Emirates... Beth	1

Any advice would be good as I am quite nervous about flying alone and dont want any problems when I arrive! Thanks, Beth :-)	My parents have only ever visited here with Emirates Airlines. They have been 3 times now and have had no problems whatsoever. However, these new regulations have come in to effect ... but as mentioned, speaking to people who had just had visitors they have had no problems and wasn't asked to provide anything. If you are a bit nervous ... you can get your friends to organise a meet and greet service for you. You can book them at any Qatar Airways office ... doesn't matter what airline you are arriving in. Costs around 70 riyals (can't remember exactly) and they will meet you when you get off the plane, seat you in a room with refreshments then organise your visa .. you can pay a bit extra (10 riyals) and they will even pick up your luggage for you and escort you thru customs It's a great service, especially if you are unsure or nervous. Good luck.	1

They're required by law to make sure they're not carrying undesirable aliens, so it's in their interest to make sure everything's in order. I'm pretty sure you'll be OK so long as you can persuade immigration that you're a bona-fide short term tourist, which is why a hotel booking is recommended. It might help to have ask your friends for their job details, address & RP number. (They'll know what that is.) If you're at all young or attractive, they'll be suspicious that you might be a prostitute. Note that in all these respects, it's exactly the same for non-EC tourists entering the UK or Brits entering the USA.	1

This is the first time for me planning to visit some country in the region of the Middle East and I thought it would be better if I get all the needed info in advance. The problem is that I am not sure what kind of visa should I be obtained, as a southeastern European citizen (but still not in the EU), during the visit that I have planned for upcoming December. My girlfriend is employed by a certain company in Doha for past two months and Iâ€™d be staying at her flat for about 3 weeks. I've heard it is almost illegal being at apartment of a woman with a â€˜singleâ€™ marital status! Is this possible?? Iâ€™d be very grateful if someone could provide me some info about the local regulations or any suggestion considering my case. Thank You in advance for any help provided!	0

Im going to ring embassy on Monday and find out once and for all. Can I book that service while in the UK or does someone else need to do it for me and if so can they arrange it when they come to get me from the airport in Doha or does it need to be in advance?
